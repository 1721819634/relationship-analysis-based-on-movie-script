July 16, 2003:



TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND. We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet. CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her side.

Woman: (into phone) Yes Donna, I'm out the door. We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the kitchen, unable to see her face.

Woman (cont'd): Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and I'll be there as soon as I can. Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she talks.

Woman (cont'd): And promise her she's about to have a woooonnderful labor. As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket. They give each other a silent wave.

Woman (cont'd): Right, I'll see you in twenty. She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead.

Jessica: Buenas dias, Rosario.



Rosario: Good morning Miss Jessica. Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY. In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

Male voice: (on machine) Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the- And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips-- SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion. Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark. Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

Lead gunman: Get away from there! Don't touch that -- !! -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica.

Lead gunman (cont'd): (dire) Where is he? Jessica cringes.

Jessica: Where is who?

Lead gunman: Wrong answer. The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold. Then he turns to his men.

Lead gunman (cont'd): Search the house. And as the answering machine fills the silence:

Craig vo: (on machine) -I'll call back later. The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness of his masked face.

MATCH CUT TO:



EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing. As the van stops--

WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:

INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid. Imposing.

Jessica: Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

Jessica (cont'd): No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

Jessica (cont'd):

NO!   PLEASE--// SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--



Jessica (cont'd): Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

DISSOLVE TO:

The ocean: Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

Pier.:

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN. The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed. Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is: RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi Master of the game. Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the screen.

Ryan: You recording this?

Chad (os): Yeah, sure... CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone. Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes on the shoulder.



Ryan: Move, bitch. He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD." Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

Kid: Nice. The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

Ryan: Get that? Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

Chad: Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

Ryan: C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that. Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

Chad: (through cup-holding teeth) Sweet. It's going to my email right now. S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad wipes it dry on his pants.

Ryan: Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in seven days.

Chad: They aren't giving you shit yet?

Ryan: Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else. Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

CUT TO:

The ocean: As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in, but it's still a forty foot drop.


RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal.

Chad: Go already. No one's looking. His left hand holds his WALLET.

Chad (cont'd): (re: wallet) Need me to hold that? Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

Ryan: Waterproof. But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left leg starts trembling like crazy.

Ryan (cont'd): This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick another dare. Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

Chad: My ass. Not after you made me march in the Gay Pride Parade wearing a thong.

Ryan: Screw it then. In one... Two... Two and a half--

Chad: Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot. Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to the deck.

Chad (cont'd): Just so you know, I'm emailing this to every chick you ever met. But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are glued to something else--

Chad (cont'd): (speaking like HAL 900) Transmitting pussy file now. CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the "Heal The Bay" rally. Ryan walks over like he owns the place.



Ryan: Got any more? I'm here to help.

Chloe: Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

Ryan: What's in 'em? Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

Ryan (cont'd): Cool, you're handing these out during the concert?

Chloe: Yeah, wanna help? Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

Ryan: Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the Bay. " His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

Ryan (cont'd): Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course... An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

Ryan (cont'd): We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade... I'm surprised I haven't seen you. He offers his hand.

Ryan (cont'd): Ryan. She takes it.

Chloe: Chloe. The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

Chloe (cont'd): I can't tell if you're full of it. Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

Ryan: You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there all



Ryan (cont'd): the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back.

Chloe: Maybe you and I can take a break later when Pat Benatar goes on.

Ryan: Sounds like a plan. There's a moment...     Then --

Chloe: Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to pick up a box of T-shirts at the Kinkos on Venice.

Ryan: I'll do it for you... if you want.

Chloe: Seriously, you would?

Ryan: Sure.     How much is the bill?

Chloe: Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

Ryan: Do you promise not to go anywhere?

Chloe: Done. Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

Ryan: Okay, I won't be long.

Chloe: (laughing) Bye. Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

Ryan: Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier?

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE - DAY
A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice neighborhood.


Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now sits on the shotgun seat. Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush. He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing. Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone.

Ryan: (into phone) Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light.

Ryan (cont'd): Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, (quickly adding) I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily.

Ryan (cont'd): (covering his ear) What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

With static.:

Ryan (cont'd): (into phone) Dex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

Ryan (cont'd): Damn.

EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10
As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--


ID                                                                   iu





SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS. Ryan picks up the phone.

Ryan: Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's my Caller ID say? But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.

Ryan (cont'd): Yo Dex...?

MATCH CUT TO:

11   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          11

ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES 12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12 the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone, foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS, tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:

Ryan (vo): Hello...? Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a desperate hope filling her eyes.

CUT BACK TO:

13   INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS                                   13 With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --

Ryan: Whatever.    Signing off- -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny female voice on the other end.

Jessica (vo): Wait!    Don't hang up! Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.

Ryan: Hello?

Jessica (vo): There's not much time! I need you to go to the police. My name is Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!

Ryan: (not buying) Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?


13                                                                          j.j





Jessica (vo): Please. I know what you're thinking, but it's real! I'm in an attic somewhere. I think they're going to kill me! You need to-

Ryan: Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone... Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful and frustrated.

Jessica (vo): No!   You don't understand! Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls it away and looks at its faceplate.

14   INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE                                            14 The LCD reads:     CALL WAITING.   ACCEPT?

15   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY                                             15

Ryan: If you were really in trouble, you would've called the cops, not me. Now I've got a real call on the other line--

MATCH CUT TO:

16   INT. ATTIC                                                             16 A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.

Jessica (vo): Goddamn it, listen to me! The phone I'm on...it's shattered! There's no dialer! I've been clicking wires together for hours trying to get someone, anyone, and you 're the only connection I was able to make! (important beat) If you hang up, I may not get anyone else.

17   INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN FORD BRONCO/JESSICA BOUND IN ATTIC             17 SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.        He considers everything Jessica has said, then:

Ryan: Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank yanking someone else. Late.



17:





Jessica: Wait!     Don't hang up!    DON'T HANG UP!! But -- CLICK!       Ryan flashes over to the next call.

Ryan: Dex?

MATCH CUT TO:

18   INT. TELEMARKET BULLPEN - DAY                                    18 A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at the script.

Telemarketer: Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is Mark and I'd like to discuss with you the benefits of Mastercharge Credit Union's-

Ryan (vo): Awesome, I can totally use a credit card. Tell me more.

Telemarketer: Absolutely.     We've lowered our APR-

Ryan: -Shucks, now's really not a good time, but why don't I get your number and get back to you later.

Telemarketer: Sure, it's 818...

Ryan: That's the office number?

Telemarketer: Yes.

Ryan: Why don't you give me your number instead. That way I can call you when you're having dinner with your family. A beat.

Telemarketer: Sorry to have bothered you. Click!    The Telemarketer hangs up.

Ryan: Damn skippy. And that's when he notices the message flashing on the phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.



INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19

Jessica (vo): --an you hear me?!

Ryan: You still there? You're getting kinda creepy, lady. See ya.

Jessica: No!    Don't! They're going to kill me!    They're going to kill me!! A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes... RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold. On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.

Ryan: Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with the fake tears, lady...

Jessica: Please...   I just need help. But Ryan won't be manipulated.

Ryan: You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else.

Jessica: These men!!!-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control.

Jessica (cont'd): These men killed my housekeeper. My dog. You have to help me. Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.

Ryan: No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier.

Jessica: Please...you're my only hope. (beat) What's your name? That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make this personal.

Ryan: Why, you writing a book--?


19                                                                  x?





Jessica: --Please, just tell me your name! Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a French Restaurant.

Ryan: Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.

Jessica: Johnny... What if it was your mother who was calling for help? How would you feel?

Ryan: Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead.

Jessica: Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police?! I'll pay you!

Ryan: How much?

Jessica: Five thousand dollars.

Ryan: Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.

Jessica: No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's a eighty percent chance I'm lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life. (panics as Ryan is silent) Haven't you ever bet on a horse or bought a Lottery ticket? I'm talking one-in-five odds, twenty minutes. Ryan slaps the radio off.

Ryan: What do you want me to do?

20   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - STATION DESK - DAY                        20

Someone's pov.: In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a nightmare -- OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on



20                                                                     ^


an OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant through invisible soup. Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE lets us know we're in hell. CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked. MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall, legal but hard. SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR? CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

Left wrist.: MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly -- WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed into the station desk by a ROOKIE.

Rookie officer: Problem, Mooney. If I put this one in with the others, there's gonna be a bloodbath.

Gangbanger: Put me in there! I'll waste all them pussies! REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.

Mooney: Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room. Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the Gangbanger back over to the holding cells. Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21 a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him, FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court; being led away in handcuffs.

News reporter: ...was somber when the indictments came down this afternoon in the 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Though the names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney stated that this was merely the "tip of the iceberg" and that unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the investigations proceed.



'2    BACK TO POLICE STATION                                      22 As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.

Detective tomlin: Sucks for the fellas at the Two- Three right now, huh?

Mooney: Dirty pricks deserve what they get. Public hates us enough without this shit.

Detective tomlin: (leaving) There's good men over there. A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of pizza.

Female officer: Mooney? What are you doing?      You can't be eating this crap. Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.

Mooney: Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to see here. A friendly tug of war.

Female officer: You sure you wanna do that?     What would your wife say? That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to lecture this little girl.

Mooney: She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not gonna know about it! Christ, Shel, my old man had eleven heart attacks. Eleven! I have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like an invalid! I'm a grown man! Leave me alone, will you?!

Female officer: (abashed) I was merely referring to your cottage-cheese ass. Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when -- WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG MEMBERS are bum-rushed into the room by a squad of COPS in riot gear. The screaming is deafening.

23   EXT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 23 The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until he's far enough away from the car to start running.

Ryan: (into phone) I'm here.

24   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 24 Cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who cram the Station Desk, waiting to be booked. Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:

Mooney: is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers. Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood, Etc.

Ryan: Excuse me, officer -- But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that suddenly need arrest sheets signed.

Ryan (cont'd): Hey, I've got an emergency here -- Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.

Crackhead trannie: Loosen these, man, please?! Jus' gimme a chance--

Crewcut officer: Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to put Whitney Houston?

Mooney: Christ, I've only got two hands here! Stick him in the can, will ya? Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.

Ryan: (shoving forward) Come on, man! I've got some lady on the phone here who says she's been kidnapped!

Ryan holds up the phone.         Mooney looks around.

Mooney: Nice try, kid, but I got no time for pranks.

Ryan: Seriously, a lady was murdered!

Mooney: Which is it, a kidnapping or a murder?

Ryan: Take the phone and find out moron! A COP snickers somewhere.

Jessica: Please. . .

6    BACK TO POLICE STATION                                                26 Ryan looks sincere.     Mooney deliberates, then sighs.

Mooney: Okay.   Give it here. Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.

Jessica (vo): (barely audible whisper) Oh thank God! You've got to help me. My name's Jessica Martin and I've been kidnapped. This morning five men broke into my home in Brentwood and kidnapped-- Mooney strains to hear.     His eyes go wide and he quickly jots notes on a pad. Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.

Mooney: Ah shit. Mooney holds out the phone.

Mooney (cont'd): Hurry kid, take this upstairs to Robbery/Homicide and ask for Detective Tomlin.

SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

Ryan (vo): Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her, they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.

Lead kidnapper: Where's your husband?

Jessica: What?     I don't- The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her. The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.

Lead kidnapper: Where is he!?

Jessica: At work!     Why, what do you want--? SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first.

Jessica: Please, he should be at work! That's all I know. The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is short-lived as:

Lead kidnapper: You have a little boy, right? Ricky? The Wyman School in Westwood? Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest.

Jessica:

NO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

Leave him alone!!: But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM!       The door locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone.

Jessica (cont'd): Johnny!!

Jessica: My son -- Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts breaking up the call.

Jessica (cont'd): (worried) Oh my God! What's happening?!

Ryan: It's just static. I'm running upstairs to the detectives. Hold on, I might lose you for a sec--

Jessica (vo): (realizing) No, don't! Stop. You can't lose me--

Ryan: (still running) Wait, we're almost there.

Jessica: (panics, losing her cool) Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!

STOP! IF YOU LOSE ME, I'M DEAD!! Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.

Ryan: Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?! Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.

Ryan (cont'd): Jesus!   I'm almost there! Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone. There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.

Ryan (cont'd): Crap! (shouts up stairs)

HELLO? DETECTIVE TOMLIN! WILL

SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?! There's no response.   Ryan can't believe this.

Ryan (cont'd): You're shitting me.

Jessica: Johnny, what time is it?! Johnny!

Ryan (cont'd): (yells upstairs)

IS ANYONE UP THERE?! Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.

Jessica: Johnny, listen to me. My son's school lets out at 1:45.

Ryan: Good, then if I get a cop-- Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!

Jessica: No. There's not enough time. You have to pick him up before they--

Ryan: Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I ain't goin' nowhere else-- Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.

Jessica: Please please stop standing there! He 's just a little boy!

Ryan: But I'm in a police station!

Jessica: Go! Ryan grunts in frustration.

They're all trim. Athletic. In good shape. They're UNMASKED, watching the TV with interest. The news on the corruption scandal. Greer snaps the TV off.     Checks his watch and nods grimly.

Greek: Go get the kid. Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red- headed prick (ELLIS) stand and exit the house. As Greer stalks away( BOOM DOWN the bar to REVEAL a telephone sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR LIGHT is lit. PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give Ryan and Jessica's call away. Closer and closer, until we ENTER the phone and TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRES to --

Jessica (vo): Where are you now?!

Ryan: I just got off the 405.

Jessica (vo): You've got to go faster, Johnny!

Ryan: You've gotta chill! You're stressing the crap out of me! (looking around) Where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one? Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against his better judgment.

Ryan (cont'd): What do these guys want, anyway?

Jessica (vo): How should I know?!

Ryan: What do you do?

Jessica: I'm an obstetrician. They don't want anything from me.

Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.

Ryan: So your husband's like, uber-rich?

Jessica (vo): What--? No. He's an accountant. I make more money than he does.

Ryan: Could they've mistaken you for someone else?

Jessica: No! I don't know.    None of this makes any sense. Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --

Ryan: Oh...SHIT!! Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR against another BARRIER -- Ryan cringes with every muscle! And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!

Ryan (cont'd): (smirking) ...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away, CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER. More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --

Ryan (cont'd): There's the school. Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see:

Ryan: Okay, I'm here.

Jessica (vo): How much time do we have? Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   "1:40 PM".   He enters.

Ryan: Five minutes. What's your kid's name?

Jessica (vo): Ricky.

Ryan: Ricky what?

Jessica: Martin.

Ryan: Ricky Martin? You named your kid Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you tattoo "kick me" on his ass while you were at it?

Jessica: He was named before the singer ever-

Ryan: Forget it.     What does he look like?

Jessica (vo): He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants--

Ryan: They're all wearing blue shirts and pants! Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS. As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him and wheels him around.

Ryan (cont'd): Ricky Martin? The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away.

Timid boy: Don't touch me!

Ryan: No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean to--

Timid boy: Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!! Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now beginning to take notice of him.

RYAN (INTO PHONE)
Does he have anything else? A jacket? A backpack? What's his lunch box look like?

Jessica (vo): I don't remember.

Ryan: You don't remember your own kid's lunch box?!

Jessica: I don't pack it! Rosario, our housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig, but... Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.

Ryan: Ricky Martin, where are you!? None of the Stepford kids respond.

Jessica (vo): (through tears) I wish I could give you more. Now Ryan's running.    He yells into a BATHROOM.

Ryan: Ricky Martin?

Male voice (os): Can I help you, sir? Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there. Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.

Ryan: I'm looking for a little blond boy-- (off his shocked look) --No, no! Not like that!

Gym teacher: Sir, come with me, please! Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS. Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come racing out of their classes.

Ryan: Oh shit...

As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like crazy.

Gym teacher:

Hey--11:

Ryan:

RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't believe I'm yelling this at an all- boys school. All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.

Jessica (vo): Was that the bell? Was that the bell?!

Ryan: Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!! Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.

Jessica (vo): He'11 go to the parents' pick-up spot. Oh God, they're going to get him!

"\: Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.    The Gym Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--

Gym teacher: Where do you think you're going? --causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!-- hit the pavement.

Ryan: No--! Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.

Ryan (cont'd): (desperate into phone) Jessica? You still there?!

Jessica (vo): Yes? Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.

Ryan: No one's gonna get your kid!    He's not slow, is he?

Jessica (vo): What--?   No!



28.:

38                                                                    38





Ryan: Then he won't go anywhere with strangers.

Jessica (vo): Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11 think it's Rosario and hop right in! She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the pick-up spot. Scans the lot.

Ryan: What color?

Jessica: Black!

Ryan: (looks) Of course it is. PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac Escalades.

Ryan (cont'd): There's three of them.    What's your plate?

Jessica (vo): 4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I don't remember!

Ryan: Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- (stops, realizing) Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it?

Jessica (vo): No!

Ryan: Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me.

Jessica (vo): No--


This is great, the police think I'm a whack job. The school thinks I'm some kind of perv child molester. I'll probably get the Herpes from the gym teacher's whistle --

Jessica (vo): No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.' But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave --

Ryan: I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides "screw it", and keeps on hoofing. Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

Gym teacher: Here he is! He's the one that's been stalking the students.

Ryan: Stalking?!     No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.

Rent-a-cop #1: Okay, we got him. We're at the front of the school. (then, to Ryan) Sir, come with us.

Ryan: (as they grab him) Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

Jessica (vo): (interrupting) Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week! Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

Ryan: (struggling)

Ricky martin!!: The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--

--and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off. WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.

Ryan (cont'd): Oh shit!    You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner in the car.

Rent-a-cop #1: Roy, some help over here! Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.

Ryan: (struggling harder) Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!!

Rent-a-cop #1: Roy--! ! The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!

Rent-a-cops:

Hey--! !: They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's seat. Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws the little car in gear and burns away.

Ellis: (gesturing to the radio) Do you want me to change the station to something else? Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile quickly vanishing.

Ellis (cont'd): Yeah.   I like Creedence too. He's about to turn the radio volume up when --

Ricky: Where's Rosario?

Ellis: I told you, kid, she had a doctor's appointment, so your mother asked us to pick you up. Don't worry, you'll see your mommy in a few minutes. Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that he's not buying their story one bit.

Narrowing the gap between the rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto. It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance between them, and is just starting to relax, when--

Ryan: Damn!     There's this stupid bus-- Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of the Escalade still ahead.

Ryan (cont'd): (taps his horn) Come on! But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.

Ryan (cont'd): Jesus.'

Jessica (vo): Can't you go around it? There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic-- But suddenly there's    a break in the  flow! Seizing the moment, Ryan SLAM-SH   IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder engine into gear and    starts to tear  around the bus -- but has to SWERVE BACK as a    SPEEDING TRASH  TRUCK rounds a bend and almost creams him!

Ryan: Goddamn it!

Jessica (vo): What?!    Did you lose him? !

Ryan: No, I just almost got killed, is all.

Ryan: No, No!    just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.

Ryan (cont'd): Jesus!    Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver.

Cop one: -- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on. The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.

Cop one (cont'd): So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405. Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.

Mooney: Hey Tomlin.

Detective tomlin: Taking off?

Mooney: (hardly thrilled) My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. (beat) Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping --

Detective tomlin: I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh?

Mooney: I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up--

Detective tomlin: Well, don't you get worked up. (slaps Mooney's chest) If the kid comes back, page me, and I'll be sure to see him.

Jessica (vo): Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later!

SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING.



Ryan: What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.

INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

Ryan (cont'd): Great!   Now the battery's dying.

Jessica: Don't you have a charger?

Ryan: It's in my car!      Hold on. SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.

Ryan (cont'd): Jesus -- !

Jessica: What's going on? Did you find one?

Ryan: (staring at the gun) Not exactly... SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid.

Jessica: Johnny, don't lose me!

Ryan: Well what the hell do you expect me to do?! Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is almost immediately boxed in.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!

Jessica: Johnny--!

Ryan: I know, Jessica! The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately. Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop down a HILL to a strip mall below-- STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS". Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter- mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it there.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.' Ryan's got to do something.      Now.

Ryan (cont'd): You know that money you promised me?

Jessica (vo): Yes.

Ryan: I'm giving myself a raise.

47   EXT. VERIZON MALL HILL - CONTINUOUS                             47 And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of the hill! Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear blue sky.

Ryan:

Hoooollyyy shiiii--: THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope. Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile, miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS. He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its antenna in his teeth. There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.

Jessica (vo): What's going on?!

Ryan: (with phone in teeth) mmmrrmph mrm mrmph! Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings

Ryan (cont'd): Shit! Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!

Ryan (cont'd):

Whoaaaaaa!: Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge. Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where it SKIDS OUT.

Ryan (cont'd): (grabbing phone) Jessica?! Can you hear me?!

Jessica (vo): I'm here! Ryan hops out and races inside--

48   THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS                         48 And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed. Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!! Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --

Irate customers: Hey, what do you think you're doing? There's a line! -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.

Overly-perky salesman: ..and if you get the new Nokia 9200, you can switch out faceplates to match your mood! And we have a special today on tiger stripes... Are you feeling fierce? The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.

Easily-excitable customer: Oh, how fun!

Ryan: Excuse me--

Overly-perky salesman: I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer now.

Overly-perky salesman (cont'd): (indicates a number dispenser) But if you take a number, someone will be with you shortly. Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her.

Ryan: Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency here --

Busy saleswoman: Sorry, I'm on break--

Ryan: Damn it, will you listen to me?! I've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! Do you have a charger?

Busy salesman: Sure. (walks away) Take a number and one of the sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up.

_/ -:



Ryan: Bu t-- !

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!! Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.

Ryan (cont'd): Help, I --

Saleswoman: Take a number. The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!


Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --

Ryan: Aw, screw this... -- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST!

Mooney exits the mayhem of the s   tation and walks to a SQUAD CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his      seatbelt on, something CRINKLES in his breast pocket.     He pulls it out -- the SCRAP OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and "BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him    the phone. Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and address appear on the screen:

JESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.


Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.

Mooney: Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a few minutes late... And as Mooney closes the door and starts up the engine--

Ryan: Yeah, look, about that... (awkward beat) My-name isn't really Johnny Fountain.

Ryan: It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just a little freaked out right now. Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.

Jessica: Thank you, Ryan. But before they can say any more, suddenly--

SFX: FEET ON THE STAIRS - COMING TOWARD THE ATTIC! Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails. The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED! Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.    He stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:

Jessica: N-no... Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.

Jessica (cont'd): ...but I am going to, aren't I?

Greer: Up to you. Your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field. Where's that?



Jessica: What?   I don't understand--? Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.

Greer: --A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne does he mean?!

Jessica: (choking out the words) I... I don't know what you want me to say. I swear--

Greer: Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you! Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--

Jessica: Wait! The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium! That's where we first met.

Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment, searching her soul. She's lying.

Jessica (cont'd): Please! Believe me. That has to be where he means. I swear to God. Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!

Greer: Working in my profession as long as I have, you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it. Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.

Greer (cont'd): (turning back) Go to the window, Jessica. There's something I want you to see. Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to the attic window -- and GASPS.

Hodges: Shoot hoops.

Ricky: I..   I don't feel like it.

Hodges: (threatening) Shoot. Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball.

Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own personal hell. For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

Ryan: Jessica... ? There's an emotional beat, then--

Jessica: Do you think God will forgive me?

Ryan: What do you mean--?

Jessica: For what I've done...   For giving up Craig... Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.

Ryan: Jessica, they have your kid. You had no choice.

Jessica: I don't know. I don't know...

Ryan: 1 know. I heard what they were doing to you over there. You held out for as long as you could.

Jessica: (grim beat) My son and I are going to die here, Ryan. They already have us. But maybe I could've saved Craig... The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair -- Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he had.

Ryan: Jessica, listen to me. I promise you, I'm not going to let that happen. I could care less about your money. I'm risking my life cause I know I'm gonna get you and your family out of this. You hear what I'm sayin'?

RYAN (INTO PHONE)
I'm already on my-- Suddenly, the cab rounds a bend -- and grinds to a halt from backed up traffic!

Ryan (cont'd): You've gotta be kidding me! (to cabbie) Can't you back it up? The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling up behind him. Shrugs. About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close...

Ryan (cont'd): Aw, screw this! Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger side and starts RUNNING.

108   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY                                        108 A short time later, Ryan( drenched in sweat, sees Craig's office building in the distance --

109   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING - ESTABLISHING           109 With an all cement exterior (and few windows), it's a cellphone user's nightmare.

Ryan stops and stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE HELMET hanging on the handlebars. The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the Messenger hot on his heels.

111   EXT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. BUILDING                              111 As Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in front of him and Greer, Hodges and Ellis file into the building.

Jessica (v.o.): Wait, we --(bzzt!)--ve to think! What --(bzzt!)--re we going to do?

Ryan: I have an idea... Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay. Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs, there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor.

Marilyn: In five minutes, I'll need you to give me a hand.

Mooney: Whenever you're ready, hon. Still wearing his holster, he shifts uncomfortably on the bed as he watches the news.

News anchor: ...and authorities are now asking your help in identifying this man-- Mooney jolts upright as they display A FUZZY PHOTO OF RYAN from the Verizon surveillance cameras.

News anchor (cont'd): -- believed to be responsible for today's bizarre string of crimes, most notably the theft of an $80,000 Cadillac at gunpoint.

Mooney: What..? Mooney watches as they continue to detail Ryan's "wild crime spree", but gets the bigger picture, realizing that every event --the Verizon store; searching for the Martin kid;

Operator: Thank you for using Pacbell. This is Claire, how may I help you?

Mooney: I need the phone number for a residence. Jessica Martin in Brentwood.

Operator: That number is (310) 555-8364.    For an extra seventy five cents- Mooney hangs up, dials the number. The phone rings and rings. Eventually, an answering machine picks up.

JESSICA'S VOICE  (VO) Hi, you've reached the hom  e of Craig and Jessica Martin.   We can't get to the phone right now  , but if you leave your name and a   message-- Mooney listens intently -- and is troubled.

Mooney: (to an oblivious Marilyn) The woman at the house didn't have an accent. Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself. Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and without looking he grabs his wallet and keys. He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head. She knows him, and knows something's up.

Mooney (cont'd): I'm sorry honey( but I have to check on something real quick.

Marilyn: You've got to be kidding-

Mooney: Delay the reservation if you have to; I'll be back in twenty minutes. And Mooney's gone...

Marilyn: Twenty minutes my foot.

115   INT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. - THIRD FLOOR - DAY                115 Dripping with sweat, Ryan shambles out of the stairwell, the bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him! As Greer, Hodges and Craig get out, Ryan turns and searches for the mailroom that's supposed to be here! Where the hell is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --

116   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     116 A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side. Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty cops enter, brushing right past him. Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter, desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet. Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area, but knows better than to make any waves.

Mailroom supervisor: (recognizing Craig) Anything I can help you with Mr. Martin?

Craig: Hey, Benny. This might sound ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD mailer into the chute this morning and I forgot to put down an address.

Mailroom supervisor: Happens all the time. Let me see what's back there. Gimme a sec'. The Supervisor disappears into the back room. Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan. The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--

Mail clerk ,: Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir? Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is speaking to him.

Ryan: Me?

Mail clerk: You waiting for a package? Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer.

Ryan: (facing away) Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.

Mail clerk: From what department?

Ryan: I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?

Mail clerk: What's the tracking number?

Ryan: (patting himself down) Uh... Right. Tracking number. It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.

Mailroom supervisor: Mr. Martin? I found a number of things that could be what you're looking for. Mind coming back to take a look? Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

Craig: Sure. The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room. Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.

Ryan: (patting himself) I might... Maybe it's on the clipboard on my bike? Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and Craig disappear inside the vault.

Mailroom supervisor: Help yourself. HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers, opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside down -- and a DVD case slides out! A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'. 5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

Craig: This is it. Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over his shoulder.

Hodges: Let's go.

Ryan: You believe this? Everyone's got their head up their ass over there. The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to. Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window at the end of the hall.

Mail clerk: (impatiently) Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard? Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

Mail clerk (cont'd): Sir? Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone. At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the door --

A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and suddenly realizes: This is the guy! It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

Mail clerk (cont'd): Sir!?

Ryan: (to Clerk) Screw the package. Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

Mail clerk:

WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?! -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges drops like a slaughterhouse cow. Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has come to life; drawing down on them.

Security guard:

119   INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                      119 At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --

Security guard (os):

Freeze!!: -- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his gun on him instead.

Security guard (cont'd):

Drop your weapon!: Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.

Greer: (flashing his badge)

L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!

Security guard:

Drop it now!!: The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --

Bang! bang!:

-The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig again! BANG! -- Greer fires. Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact. They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

Craig: ..run... But Ryan is overwhelmed.       His legs feel like a thousand pounds of jelly.

Craig (cont'd): ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!! As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he DIVES into:

Ryan: Damn! --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.

Hodges: The kid!!

Greer: No shit.

Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

Guard: (racing down the hall) This way! The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a hunch, he turns and continues running UP also. Peeking over the edge from the floor above--

Ryan: Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready. Shit.' THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell on every floor. Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof. He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

123   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                               123 GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up toward the-

Air conditioner...: Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it. Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down. Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

Greer: (to Hodges) Here. Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp- covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other. This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around -- But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

Greer (cont'd): Dammit! No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on ground level.

Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

The alarm stops.: Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

Reveal --:

ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN. From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

Jessica (vo): Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to discuss Craig.

Jessica: You have to talk to me! Ryan, please you have to talk to me--.' The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the stressed metal. Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear. Desperate to console her, Ryan -- BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks up to see it angrily launching itself right at him! He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses himself to one side but -- WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

Simon cowell's cellphone!:

Deason:

Deason:

Deason (cont'd):

WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU

Told?!:

Jessica:

NO, DON 'T H URT M E-- Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand. HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR, shattering it in a million pieces around her. Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

Jessica: Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

Deason: (sarcastic) Oooh. --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

Jessica: Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic.

Though it's protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the glass. Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.    When her son sees her, he races to the bars.

Mooney: Drop your gun, now.   I got you. Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some cover, gun aimed and steady.

Mooney (cont'd): I said drop it.' Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs, following her into--

Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have successfully created an element of surprise for himself-- SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY! Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang-- But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!   Two miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER! OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of- BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload-- Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.

Mooney: Damn it!   DAMN IT!! Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her gun away and kneels. But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.   Just scared.

Bayback: ..a-ambulance...

Mooney: Tell me where Jessica Martin is or you bleed to death right here.

Bayback: ..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a-- Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.

Mooney:

Where is she?!: Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--

Bayback: ...I'm a cop... Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts patting her down. And that's when he finds her BADGE.     L.A.P.D.   23rd Precinct. She is a cop.

Mooney: Oh shit... Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks up the phone, dials 911.

Greer: These are the best pictures you could get of him?!

Ellis: He was wearing a visor. Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .

Greer: Useless! The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter -- Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something. The Escalade.

Jessica: (to son; through window) Baby, listen to me. I want you to get away from this window. I want you to go to the other side of the room as far away from the door as you can --

Ricky: No, don't leave me!     Don't leave me!! The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.

Jessica: Honey, I'm getting you out of there!

Ricky: Where are you going?!

Simon cowell: But I didn't cause it to get impounded! Can't you understand that?! It was stolen from me!

Jaded cashier: Sir, do you want the car back or not? Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

Simon cowell: Yes!     But I'm not paying for it! The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of the fence.

Jaded cashier: Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back. Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back into the yard --

As Cowell angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the switch to open the gate, and as it opens-- Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling Cadillac.

Greer: He's within visual of the car. Greer takes his police walkie and toggles it.

Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.

RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores them in favor of the raucous concert. In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s feet.

Mooney: (sweating profusely) Jesus, kid, calm down!! Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER

Railing.: Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing-- Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.

Chloe: Oh my God-- (checking Mooney) Someone call 911! A CROWD starts to gather when -- Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's gun.

Tomlin: It's over kid. Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end of the pier. MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.

Tomlin (cont'd): For all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. Where is it? Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him. Like a nightmare, he closes in. Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up.

Ryan: Aw shit... Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the

Tension...: He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts. Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.

Crowd goer (os): Dude's gotta gun! Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground. He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT! SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as he spins headlong into the Pacific! TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the CHOPPY WATER below.

Greer: Under the pier. Go! Go!

His lungs convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot needles are pushing their way through his chest. The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon! Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater, BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.

Tomlin: You're wounded kid, just give me what I came for, and I'll let you all go. Police sirens in the distance grow louder. Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends! It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound.
