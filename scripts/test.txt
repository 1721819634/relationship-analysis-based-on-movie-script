FADE IN

	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

                            world-weary air)
                   At least once a month.  Douglas
                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve
                   years you've been talking about
                   Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   That's right, Douglas.  But not
                   you.  Not us.

                           (mumbling)
                   What do they expect ... the
                   way men dress these days ...
                   then they scream rape.
