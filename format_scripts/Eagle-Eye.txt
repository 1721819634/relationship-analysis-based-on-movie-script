FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN

CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY. Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world...

EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:

Special forces leader: We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch.

INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT


SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated).

Colonel thompson: Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN

The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.

INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away:

Pentagon techie #1: We have system control.









3/28/07 2:

CONTINUED:

Colonel thompson: Activate laser mic.

EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS

DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --

INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens:

Callister: Is it him?

Translator: Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.

Colonel thompson: Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a

BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI."

Callister: I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room:

DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.

Techie: Sire they're pulling off the highway.

Techie #2: We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.

Colonel thompson: If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.

Callister: (beat, torn) Alright, stay with him...









3/28/07 3:

CONTINUED:
THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune.

EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY

Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site --

Techie: We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles --

Colonel thompson: Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -

INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION."

Techie: 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT. THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:

Callister: What is that, a weapons cache?

Analyst: Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated. THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body... THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION

Scrolls::

Techie: Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention.









3/28/07 4.:

CONTINUED:

Colonel thompson: Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --

Pentagon general council: "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation.

Techie #2: I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.

Callister: Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up:

Callister (cont'd): Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.'

The president (v.0.): You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS

(a beat, looks around). BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."

Callister: Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one.

General thompson: And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers.









3/28/07 5.:

CONTINUED: ( 2)

The president (v.0.): I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:

Callister: Understood. (hangs up) We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

Techie techie 2: -- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the acquisition's good -- target --

EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN

The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE. DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering -- The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his mother's...

A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS:

Hold in white:: CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan, as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence... We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT."

Whitewash::

INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds -- then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen: this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an adult and a child -- under his breath:

Jerry: damnit...









3/28/07 6.:

CONTINUED:

Voice (o.s.): You gotta make a choice. You gotta move--

Jerry: -- I know.

Voice (o.s.): Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table.

Jerry kwame: there. Dwarves?: Bullshit -- Bullshit? I just blocked your ass and attacked with (checks card) Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that -- -- read the oracle text, my friend. -- shit A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:

Becky: You know what would be great? If you guys took a longer break. That'd be awesome.

Jerry: Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:

Becky: .The collator's broken.

Jerry: Dude: no its not.

Becky: (putting on a jacket) Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:

Jerry: Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves. Power can come from anywhere -- tomorrow night I'll give you first roll and a bonus pack if y--









3/28/07 7.:

CONTINUED: ( 2)

Kwame: I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I'm going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are, this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.

Jerry: That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating.

Kwame: -- what? But she said the collator's broken.

Jerry: And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:

Jerry (cont'd): Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:

INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere." And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:

Shepard smith: a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH:









3/28/07 8.:

CONTINUED:

Spokesman: Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world...

EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING

An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING

Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO:

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING

A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming:

Mrs. wierzbowski: Jerry.

Jerry: Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God --

Mrs. wierzbowski: is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes?

Jerry: (puts cash in her hands) -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him --

INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table.









9.:

3/28/07:

CONTINUED:

Jerry: So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far ---

Mrs. wierzbowski: Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.

Mrs. wierzbowski (cont'd): You are hungry, I am guessing.

Jerry: Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- (looking down at bowl) Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.

Mrs. wierzbowski: So where is girl? I don't see her?

Jerry: Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart.

Mrs. wierzbowski: Like the others.

Jerry: Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered.

Mrs. wierzbowski: You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.

Jerry: Your -- I'm like your dog?

Mrs. wierzbowski: Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:

Jerry: why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --

Mrs. wierzbowski: Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.

(mc)rf ):









3/28/07 10.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Mrs. wierzbowski (cont'd): As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. (hands Jerry the cup) You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:

Jerry: This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning --

Mrs. wierzbowski: -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.

Mrs. wierzbowski (cont'd): Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:

Jerry: its my mother.

Mrs. wierzbowski: Is problem?

Jerry: (even, quieter, gets up) is problem.

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment:

Jerry: Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands. Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi. Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally, from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.









3/28/07 11.:

INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--

Jerry: -- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:

Jerry (cont'd): It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's identical twin. Off the surreal moment... A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year- old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:

Rachel: Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride --

Kyle: -- we're gonna be late, huh?

Rachel: -- absolutely not -- I turned it off, came over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the--









3/28/07 12.:

CONTINUED:

Kyle rachel: --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the phone, put it back, put the food in the fridge-- She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container. Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO:

INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING

The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense--

Rachel: we need to get a new car --

Kyle: I like your car. We're gonna be late. The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:

Rachel: No we're not: the bus.

Kyle: -- are you kidding?

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--

Rachel: I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning --

Kyle: and one at night, I know --

Rachel: And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:

Kyle: More bills?

Rachel: Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:









3/28/07 13:

CONTINUED:

Rachel (cont'd):

OH, SHIT! STAY HERE! Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--

Kyle:

You swore!!: As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:

Rachel:

I KNOW, I'M SORRY! (Porsche HONKS as it

Passes):

HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE! And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --

Kyle: You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!

Rachel:: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --

INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY

A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them --

Rachel: Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!

Wait!!: Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:

Mrs. miller: Under the wire --

Rachel: (gulping breaths) Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met--

Mrs. miller: -- of course, Barbara Miller. (looks at watch) You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her --









3/28/07 14.:

CONTINUED:

Rachel: Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time --

Kyle: I will, mom --

Rachel: -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- (turns to Mrs. Miller) He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight --

Mrs. miller: I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto --

Rachel: You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more --

Kyle: It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya..

Rachel: Fun? What's that? (hugging him) I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house.

Kyle: -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:

Rachel: Call me!

Mrs. miller: Your mom gonna be okay?

Kyle: It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA...









3/28/07 15.:

CONTINUED: (2)
We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: "HASSAD DRY CLEANERS." Loads the trumpet inside as we:

INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON

Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES:

Woman #1 (v.o.): you didn't know either?

Woman #2 (v.0.): No idea.

Woman #3 (v.0.): I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was...

Woman.#1 (v.0.): I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him:

Woman #1 (ccnt'd): when was the last time they saw him?

Woman #2: Margaret said years...

INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY

TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him...









3/28/07 16.:

CONTINUED:
It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment.

William: Six months without a boo or a bah.

Jerry: Didn't realize it'd been that long.

William: Your mom was worried. So where were you this time?

Jerry: Nowhere. (then, a touch reticent) Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p-

William: -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world.

Jerry: I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:

William: You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:

William (cont'd): I want to give you some, uh...

Jerry: No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is...

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY

CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen.









3/28/07 17:

CONTINUED:
AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The screen reads: "BALANCE: $750,000.00" What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--

Jerry: -- whoa -- Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous--

Jerry (cont'd): -- two seconds, sorry -- Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.

Jerry (cont'd): Big date. So... fingers crossed.

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs. Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her:

Mrs. wierzbowski: Jerry! All day they make delivery! Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a thousand dollars into her hand:

Jerry: Here's the rest of the rent -- next month's, too --

Mrs. wierzbowski: -- where do you get this?

Jerry: Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you --

Mrs. wierzbowski: I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours --

Jerry: For me?









3/28/07 18.:

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS: FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles him -- all the LCD says is: "ANSWER NOW."

Jerry: -- hello? A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy.

Woman's voice: Look out your window. They're coming for you.

Jerry: (totally thrown) -- what? Who is this?

Woman's voice: Jerry. You have to run.

Jerry: Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack- jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale.

Woman's voice: Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes.

Jerry: Jesus Christ -- what's happening?!

Woman's voice: Run, or you'll be captured and convicted -- go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls, goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a

TACTICAL TEAM STORMS THE HALL. ASSAULT RIFLES AIMED AT HIM:

Team leader jerry: Hands behind your head! DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! IS

NOW! DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR WE THIS ABOUT THE--THE ATM?! I

WILL FIRE! DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! Jerry's SLAMMED to the ground as we CUT TO --









3/28/07 19.:

INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s, born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a "file:

Jerry: Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I don't know how all that shit got in my apartment, but unless you're my lawyer--

Morgan: My condolences. I understand you've had a tough day.

Jerry: it hasn't been ideal.

Morgan: Your brother worked for the State Department. This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to us, Jerry clearly knew...

Jerry: You tell me.

Morgan: Were you close?

Jerry: Why? What am I doing here. I don't even know who you are. Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!

Morgan: Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the National Counterterrorism Center.

Jerry: (stares, rocked) Counterterrorism Center? You think I'm --

Morgan: -- according to phone records, your brother called you twelve times in the last year. You never called him back.

Jerry: If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't --









3/28/07 20.:

CONTINUED:

Morgan: Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places.

Jerry: What're you... saying.

Morgan: I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did.

Jerry: Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me--

Morgan: You familiar with the slogan, "Declare War on War?"

Jerry: what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!"

Morgan: Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley.

Jerry: (stares-at pic; LAUGHS) Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her. I swear to God, dude--

Morgan: Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school?

Jerry: Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point.

Morgan: You haven't been able to hold a job

Jerry: Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now.

Jerry: -- what can I say? Guess I haven't found myself yet --

Morgan: Who deposited the seven-fifty?

Jerry: For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM was obviously broken -- or do.. accidents not happen in your . universe?

Morgan jerry: The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this HSBC bank of Singapore -- is all very interesting -- but opened with a transfer from a this has nothing to do with corporation called 'The Star me!

Just curious if you knew any of Paul's friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends -- what do you mean in Singapore, oh but that's "friends"?! right, we haven't really established whether or not you two were close-- (losing it) -- I guess we were rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I watched him being lowered into the ground -- that establish anything for you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved.

Morgan: "Somebody." Who?

Jerry: A woman, I don't know! She called me and told me I was gonna be arrested. GET

REAL, MAN! DO I LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST TO

You?!?!:

Morgan: No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though.

(rises): When I come back, you'd better tell me who you work for-- And heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells;

INT. DHS OBSERVATION ROOM - HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Morgan meets supervisor MARTIN KREBS, a senior D.H.S. big wig. Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American, computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT, 20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket:

Latesha: He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up --

Krebs: What about the brother?

Latesha: Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City.

Morgan: That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying "coincidence?"

Krebs: So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule.

Grant: (eager to contribute) Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move:

Krebs: Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again.

Threat): I don't want the FBI rushing in on this. Break him. Fast. And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha:

Morgan: v m m putting you on the brother.

Latesha: Great, I'll access State's database

Morgan: No, I want you to go there.

Latesha: But, Tom, I can do everything from

Morgan's voice: you know those funny things underneath that not-so-stylish pantsuit? They're called leas. Latesha looks at him, not happy.

INT. GAMMAGE & BURNHAM LAW OFFICES - WISCONSIN - NIGHT

(to Morgan, veiled Rachel's doing paperwork at her desk. People leave. for the night. An attorney named MICHAEL approaches; warm, good- looking, by all standards, a catch. She doesn't look up.

Michael: He's out of town.

Rachel: Yup.

Michael: Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity for a second date. In theory.

Rachel: In theory -- but I gotta site-check this brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning.

Michael: Didn't we have a good time? Remember that? Our first date? Back in the 40's? He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy:

Rachel: I had a great. time, I told you that but I'm so busy and...

Michael: Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm patient, so... call me. When you're not busy.

Rachel: Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it should be somewhere around then.

Michael: I would so wait a decade for you. Call me his sophomore year, I'll prove it. And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit! really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she should... then goes back to her work. He gets in the elevator and she's left in her solitude. And now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs of it: loneliness.









3/28/07 25:

The consequence of not really letting anyone into her life. She stares off as BLING! An IM box pops up on her screen: "RACHEL HOLLOMAN. ANSWER THE PHONE." And just like that the PHONE RINGS. Rachel jumps. Staring at the IM. Then at the phone. Answers it:

Rachel: -- hello? It's the same chilling FEMALE VOICE:

Woman's voice: Click on the link at the bottom of the page. Rachel's eyes drop down to the LINK at the bottom of her screen. What? Leans out from her cubicle to look around -- NO ONE ELSE

At their desk.:

Rachel: who is this? As she clicks on the link. And a STREAMING IMAGE APPEARS: A

BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE CAM OFKYLE ON HIS TRAIN, LAUGHING WITH OTHER KIDS. Rachel's breath is taken away--

Rachel (cont'd): What's going on? Who are you --?

Woman's voice: Would you risk your life for your son? Rachel jumps to her feet,: trying to breathe through the panic. Looking around. NO ONE -

Rachel: This isn't funny! Who are you?!

Woman's voice: Ican derail his train. I can kill him at any time. I'll ask again: would you risk`. your life for your son? Suddenly the BROWSER GOES BLANK: "UNABLE TO ACCESS PAGE." Kyle's taken from her, that fast -- she gasps, terrified.

SMOKE AND FIRE AND A BLARING ALARM as Jerry FOLLOWS THE SPRINKLERS -- amazingly'each sprinkler ACTIVATES as he approaches, creating a safe path through the flames. Finally he gets to a dead end -- a WINDOW -- the FIRE RAGING behind him, heat increasing, as Jerry GRABS A NEARBY CHAIR AND --

Jerry prepares himself, then JUMPS TO A DRAIN PIPE -- grabbing it and lowering himself from the third floor -- dropping the last ten feet, landing HARD, recovering, running off --

EXT. RAISED SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

A SUBWAY TRAIN pulls into the station. WHIP PAN to find Jerry running onto the platform -- out-of-his-mind-scared -- passes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down, as if watching him -- Jerry's eyes scan the area... then he FREEZES. THE ELECTRONIC

SCHEDULE SIGN HAS CHANGED TO READ: "JERRY, BOARD TEE TRAIN"

THEN JUST AS FAST, ITS BACK TO THE SCHEDULE. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan and a team of Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the train as the DOORS CLOSE -- Morgan turns, doesn't see him.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

The train at full speed. Oblivious Commuters. Jerry tries to calm down, make some sense. Notices. the SECURITY CAMERA in the corner, turns from it. An LCD.onthe train broadcasts CNN:

Conductor (v.0.): Next stop, Montrose Station. A CELL RINGS from a phone peeking out of a SLEEPING PASSENGER'S BACKPACK. He looks at it, oddly suspicious.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

The DOORS CLOSE. Jerry sits, exhales. Then the cell phone -- which he stole -- RINGS AGAIN. He tenses. Won't answer. It finally stops ringing. Could it all be over? NO, BECAUSE THE

TRAIN'S EMERGENCY BRAKES SUDDENLY KICK IN, GEARS SCREECH, PEOPLE TUMBLE... and the train stops. Everyone looks around, confused, frightened. Suddenly, the train starts MOVING BACKWARDS--

Jerry:

Jerry: -- Jesus -- (and he answers)

Hello.:

Woman's voice: I told you not to get off yet.

Jerry: -- listen -- lady -- who are you?!

Woman's voice: He knows you're here. Jerry turns and sees A TRANSIT COP through the glass doors that connect the cars -- he's talking into a shoulder-mounted walkie talkie. Looking right at JERRY --

Jerry: --.how do you know that? Where are you? Jerry notices ANOTHER SECURITY CAMERA in the corner as:

Woman's voice: Next stop is Damen Station. Take the Northwest exit. There will be a black BMW sedan. Get in the passenger seat.

Jerry: Go to hell. How's that. He hangs up, drops the phone and STOMPS ON IT. Eyes from fellow passengers. THEN EVERY CELL PHONE ON BOARD RINGING IN UNISON.









3/28/07 30.:

Jerry watches, stunned, as passengers start answering -- all hearing the same thing:

Woman's voice: The man in the black t-shirt is a wanted terrorist. His name is Jerry Shaw. Everyone TURNS TO Jerry, backs away, but a HUGE MAN stands:

Huge man: -- you Jerry Shaw? EVERYONE looking, a few even start to move for him. Jerry goes for the door, but the SUBWAY COP'S there, about to enter, but the door's locked. Jerry yells to the passengers.:

Jerry:

STAY AWAY FROM ME! The COP pulls his gun, yelling through the glass:

Transit cop:

Minds blown, they swing past the crane's DRIVER'S SEAT and see... NOBODY'S AT THE CONTROLS. The crane DIPS THEM toward a wooden railing overlooking the RIVER -- they CRASH THROUGH it. The release arm DROPS the BMW -- Jerry and Rachel SCREAM as they PLUMMET -- but the car doesn't hit water, instead it falls onto: A GARBAGE BARGE floating downriver. The car lands in a mountain of trash. The crane STOPS, just as... Morgan and the cops APPEAR, screeching in at the broken railing.









3/28/07 35.:

CONTINUED:
They jump from their cars, look down into the river and see NOTHING. Morgan KICKS a trash can, pissed:

Morgan: Seal the harbor, get divers in the water! PAN UP TO the horizon... where the garbage barge floats lazily down Lake Michigan. Jerry and Rachel escaped... for now.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BARGE - DAWN

Jerry, dazed but driven, SLAMS a piece of plywood again and again into the LEXAN WINDOW of the barge's CONTROL BOOTH. Rachel paces, on her cell -- hearing:

Kyle's voice: This is Kyle. Who is not allowed to. use this phone with my friends... so leave a message, Mom. (BEEP --}

Rachel: Honey? Honey? It's me -- Baby, you need to call me. Soon as you get this, 1 please -- check your messages and.call me. Sweetie. I love y_ou. And she hangs up, staring'off. CRASH! Jerry's knocked the window back -- opens the control booth door and enters, examines the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE."

Jerry: -- this thing's on auto-pilot or something. Which doesn't happen, these barges are operated, by people. He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:

Rachel: D'youthink -- she could derail a train?

Jerry: Are you kidding me? She changed every traffic light! This woman's called me on other people's phones -- some dude who happened to be sitting next to me! His phone rang -- it was her! For me! She broke me out of maximum-security custod in a way I'm not even gonna tell you cause you won't believe it -- and you saw how she directed us away from the police, then lifted us outta the world and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge! Can she derail a train? She could probably turn a train into a duck. Yes. I think she c--









3/28/07 36.:

-- but now he stops, because Rachel is crying. Jerry lamely attempts to backpedal:

Jerry (cont'd): I mean... I don't know, I'm not sure she could derail a train, what the hell do I know? Rachel brushes her tears away. Afraid, but fighting it.

Rachel: My son is on a train. She threatened to kill him if I don't do what she says. They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an instant. She has something to lose.

Rachel (cont'd): You tell me -- how does someone do all this? When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle -- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone.

Jerry: -- you see what I mean? He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench;

Jerry (cont'd): Hello?

Woman's voice: You both need to swim to shore. Go to line tower 108.

"jerry rachel: "Swim to shore? Are you -- she wants us to swim --?! insane?

Jerry: Lady, what if I told you we don't know how to swim.

Woman's voice: But you do. I've seen you at the beach house. (Jerry is chilled) And the female was once a swimming instructor at the YMCA in Westport, Connecticut. Go now or the authorities will find you. They're more dangerous than the water.

CLICK -- she's gone. Jerry hangs up, turning something unnerving in his mind.

Jerry: She called you "the female." (beat, weird) That's like... something a foreigner would say, like a bad translation. But she has no accent.

Rachel: Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we swimmincr?

Jerry: Does it bring back memories of Westport Y?

Rachel: (pale, at a whisper) how did you know that?

Middle eastern man: (looks at his watch) I will pay you triple. Please. A courier will be by to pick it:'up at three. Do it, please... please. And stepping back, he exits quickly. The Store Owner watches him leave, then looks back down at the BOX.

INT. RIVER SIDE - DAY

A Coast Guard cutter floats beside the now-abandoned garbage barge. The BMW's been lifted ashore by a crane -- FORENSIC TECHS comb every inch. MORGAN circles the car. Grant follows, a WAITING CHOPPER in the background.

Agent grant: All the surveillance cameras in the area have turned up nothing -- no ID on the girl, nothing on the VIN --

Morgan: All I want is a goddamn picture of her -- what about traffic cams? There are more cameras on that route than the Super

Agent grant: Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper --

Morgan: Nobody who works for me calls me sir. understand?! It's disingenuous -- might as well be calling me 'asshole.' As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed.

EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY

An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers... Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then:

Rachel: So you're a twin.

Rachel: -- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--

Jerry: Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108:

Rac he l: Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not trying to insult his memory --

Jerry: he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying --

Rachel: I'm implying if not him... then why you?

Jerry: Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist.

(then): What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't "manual-shift driver."









3/28/07 41.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Rachel: I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything.

Jerry: Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:

Rachel: Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them.

Middle eastern man: Are you Jerry Shaw?

Jerry: who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --

JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she said. I'm done. The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.

Jerry (cont'd): -- dropped off what? Who are you?

Middle eastern man: Take it -- He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between them. Then:

Jerry: what's it for?

Middle eastern man: I don't know -- I don't care -- but I will not drive you. You take the van (touches his EAR: beat) I'm not listening to you any more! And the man turns to go, just walks away.

Rachel jerry: -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know!









3/28/07 42:

CONTINUED: (3)
And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING --

Jerry:

Wait!!: And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round --

Jerry (cont'd): What do you know?

Middle eastern man: -- let me go!

Jerry: -- who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its for her -- she answers:

Woman's voice: Stop him now or he will die.

Rachel: (looking around) How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches:

Middle eastern man: Let go of me! On Rachel:

Woman's voice: Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --

Rachel: Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:

Middle eastern man: I cannot! I have a family!!!

Rachel: She's going to KILL YOU!









3/28/07 43.:

CONTINUED: (4)
And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE -- HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET, the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE. And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY

THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE

AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING... Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away. Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each - other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror -

Rachel (cont'd) jerry.: Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly:

Jerry: You killed him... you killed that man...

Woman's voice: It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.

Jerry rachel: she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:

Jerry: -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT

THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT --









3/28/07 44.:

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY


-- stops.: Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck, which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION

THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS

DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:

"BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. "- And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:

INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY

-- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks:

Weapons developer: That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, "Rex" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:

Colonel thompson: Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying:

Weapons developer: Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger.

Callister: What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? (half smile) A song on a radio? A howling dog?

Weapons developer: No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce.









3/28/07 45:

CONTINUED:

Colonel thompson: Fine job.

Weapons developer: Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance -- all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM SPEAKING, we CUT TO:

INT. CLEAN PREP-ROOM - HALLOWAY-SMITH LABS- CONTINUOUS

A TECHNICIAN at an assembly line where ROBOT ARMS_ work on a stream of components: the careful manufacturing of HEX. The acoustic trigger and its crystal counterpart.

Weapons developer.(v.0.): If you're satisfied with today's final test, the Hex Project has met every... contractual objective. The arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with shipping labels marked: "PENTAGON DIRECT."

WEAPONS DEVELOPER (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: "OVERRIDE IN PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION." Robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line. A new label's printed:

"ASHLAND & SONS CIO JERRY SHAW."

INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY

Latesha walking down a hallway. Endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings. Her CELL RINGS. It's Morgan:

Morgan (v.o.): Whaddya got?

Latesha:

(sotto): Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn't State --

EXT. SKIES ABOVE CHICAGO - DAY

A chopper ROARS over skyscrapers. Morgan beside the PILOT in front, listening to Latesha over his helmet headset.

Latesha (v.0.): -- he was Defense.









3/28/07 46.:

Morgan: You're kidding me. What capacity?

Latesha (v.0.): Black-file: classified B-36.

Morgan: B what?

INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

She turns a corner. DOWN THE HALLWAY a PHALANX of GENERALS, MILITARY PERSONNEL and SCURRYING ASSISTANTS heading towards a set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen -

Latesha: That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her --

Mp: Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.

M.p.: -- sorry.

Latesha: (to M.P.) Everybody in this place have a six-foot height requirement? (continues walking; back to Morgan) Anyway. I'm going back to the office to--

Morgan (v.0.): No, no, no --

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

The PILOT signaling to Morgan--

Pilot: -- I got the Williamson County Sheriff on the line -- Morgan holds up a hand, one second. To Latesha:









3/28/07 47.:

Morgan: Look, I don't have time for this -- stay there til you get some answers --

Latesha (v.o.): -- but its a total shut out --

Morgan: Simms: step up --

INT. PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS


Morgan (v.o.): -- I don't care if you have to go to the. top to do it. Whatever means necessary, got it? Whatever means. CLICK. Latesha lowers the phone. A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle of EL-ALAMEIN looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the hallway as all the BRASS heading into the MEETING ROOM and catches sight of -- CALLISTER amongst them. Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it. Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out --

Latesha: Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face.

Latesha (cont'd): Well, shit.

INT. DRY CLEANING VAN - CITY STREETS - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY

The van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: "WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation.

Jerry: how old is he? Your son.

Rachel: (in no mood to share) Kyle. He's nine.

Jerry: What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT:









3/28/07:

48.:

CONTINUED:

Rachel: He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

Jerry: wow. And you. Hm. She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head. Knows what he's thinking.

Rachel: Parents weren't allowed to go... is that okay with you?

Jerry: Is it okay? I could give a shit.

Rachel: Then what's with the qualified nod?

Jerry: I'm not allowed to nod?

Rachel: Not if you're iudging me.--

Jerry.: Judging?! I'm just making conversation.

Rachel: You think I should have gone with him anyway.

Jerry: I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.

Rachel: Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there?

Jerry: Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad?









3/28/07 49.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Rachel: As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --?

Jerry: Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you --?

Rachel: -- you're one of those "thirties are the new twenties" man-children. You're glib and wry and find humor in people like me who are actually accountable for the ir lives --

Jerry: Okay, the most fascinating thing here? Is that you don't know the first thing about me!

Rachel: I know you work at a copy store! What are you, thirty-one, thirty-two? You're obviously articulate

Jerry: -- love being stuck in a van with my fucking guidance counselor --

Rachel: -- and I know your brother just died and he worked for the State Department --

Jerry: -- you need to stop talking about my brother, I've had enough of that --

Rachel jerry: -- you're in denial if you -- Ham: I'm not talking about don't think that has anything this -- to do with what's happening right now -= -- Dammit!! I'm not kidding! :but I can tell you that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door.

Rachel:

Jesus!--what're you d--?'.: Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut --









3/28/07:

50.:

CONTINUED: (3)

Rachel (cont'd): You can't leave me!

Jerry: Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door

Rachel: Don't walk away!

Jerry: (throwing up arms) I'm done.

Rachel: Please!

Jerry: You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin :

Rachel: Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear.

Jerry: I'm sorry? What'd you just say?

Rachel: I can't do this without you.

Jerry: You mean without the "man-child?" Rachel's reserves crumble.

Rachel: Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- (almost whispering) -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her.

Jerry: No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again --









3/28/07 51.:

CONTINUED: (4)

Rachel: Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van.

EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY


THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM. Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene.

Power worker: Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.

Sheriff: No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. (points off) Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints.

Morgan: And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:

Agent grant: Agent Morgan!" (out of breath, sotto) Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice.

Morgan: Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?

Agent grant: Yes, s-- (catches himself) Yes I am.

Medical examiner: Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS --

Grant: Looks like a bone mic, military grade.









3/28/07 52.:

CONTINUED:

Morgan: Can't even get these things on the black market. (looks around landscape) Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:

Sheriff: We'll be needing that for evidence!

EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY

Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable...

Rachel: a Federal bank?

Jerry: Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison.

INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY

A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES:

Manager: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box.

Jerry: (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:) yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN.

INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY

They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry:









3/28/07 53.:

CONTINUED:

Manager: Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box.

Rachel: You gonna open it?

Jerry: Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.

Rachel: Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW."

Jerry rachel: Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:

WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:

Rachel: -- what?!

Jerry: -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering.

Jerry (cont'd): Excellent.

Rachel: What now -- what are we?

BUT THE VAULT NEXT DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS--









3/28/07 54.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Jerry rachel: -- they're coming--we're supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?! (hands her a GUN) -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! -- hey, I applaud your parenting skills -- take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun:

Jerry: Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly --

Jerry (cont'd): Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case.

Courier #1: You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that.

Jerry: I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor:

Rachel:

DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE! Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.









3/28/07 55.:

CONTINUED: (3)

Rachel (cont'd): Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it.

Jerry rachel: impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO:

INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY

Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle:

"01:12:36. 01:12:35.":

Rachel jerry: -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?!

Woman's voice: You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:

Jerry: Would you stop doing that?!

Woman's voice: There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.

Jerry: (calling out) Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN--









3/28/07:

56:

INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY

TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING --

Rachel: How do I look?

Jerry: Like you got into a fight. Me?

Rachel: Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing.

Jerry: Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm.

Jerry (cont'd): Two jerseys and two hats, please --

Vendor: Peyton or Vinatieri?

Jerry: (shit!!!) I don't know what that means --

Rachel: Jerry...

Jerry: (shit... shit...) Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel--

Jerry (cont'd): Put these on --

Rachel:

Jer--:

Jerry: Do it!









3/28/07 57:

CONTINUED:
They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2..

1::

WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS

COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS. The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door --

Chauffeur: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game.

Jerry: Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --

Chauffeur: I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."

EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY

Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next --

Latesha: (looking UP at them all) Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.

Latesha (cont'd): Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:

Latesha (cont'd): Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I need to ask you a question, sir --









3/28/07 58.:

CONTINUED:

Callister: Not now, you can direct it to my office.

Latesha: It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not --

Callister: -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds.

Latesha: So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?

Latesha (cont'd): I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes --

Callister: You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:

Latesha: Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:

Latesha (cont'd): My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:

INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY

As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them:

Bellhop: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please -- Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:

Jerry: No! 2 trot it. (forces a smile) Thanks, though.

INT. PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY

Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner -- among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE. She's handed a NEW BADGE that reads: "TEMPORARY ACCESS." Ahead, an elevator door OPENS and we start CROSS CUTTING:

INT. ELEVATOR - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

Jerry, Rachel, and the bellhop step in. The Hop hits "Penthouse." MUZAK. They travel up:

Bellhop: So, where'd you two get hitched?

Jerry rachel: Reno. Niagara Falls. Shit.

Jerry rachel: Niagara Falls. Reno. Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO:

INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor "B-35." Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B- 36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing:









3/28/07 60.:

INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS

12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system. Standing there waiting is SCOTT BOWMAN, early thirties, hasn't seen daylight in a while:

Scott: Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36. If you'll follow me?

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS

The Bellhop dramatically opens the door --

Bellhop: Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the bed...

Bellhop (cont'd): Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand- count sheets. And if you're looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet. On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel:

Tv voice: dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort...

Bellhop: Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.

Jerry: Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him.

Rachel: This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here?

Jerry: Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol...

Rachel: What're you doing?

Jerry: If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these!

Rachel: Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately.

Woman's voice: Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen.

Woman's voice (cont'd): There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG:

Delivery boy: There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes...

Woman's voice: The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance.

Rachel: Where are we going now?

Jerry: What the hell's in the briefcase?

Woman's voice: Your only consideration at present is to deliver it before the timer expires.









3/28/07 62.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Jerry: (the breaking point) BULLSHIT! This is crazy! You're a television set! You don't watch me, I watch you! I wanna know what the hell's going on!!

Woman's voice: It would not be efficacious to reveal my intentions.

Jerry: -- "not be efficacious"?! Who the.fuck talks like that?!

Rachel: -- Jerry --

Jerry: We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowâ¢.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US

Who you are!!: Nothing. Furious, he moves to.the WINDOW --

Jerry (:cont'd): Fine, have it your way,.Lady -- I'm gonna scream bloody murder out this window 'til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and I'm gonna tell them everything even if they think I'm a crazy sonofabitch 'cause at least I won't have to listen to you any more!

Rachel:

-- jerry --: He YANKS the window up --

Woman's voice:

Stop.: He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then DIGITAL STATIC -- a channel RE-ROUTING through some distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES -- FILE FOOTAGE -- a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE --

Woman's voice (cont'd): My name... is Aria. Rachel and Jerry stare -- what the hell is this?









3/26/07 63.:

INT. PENTAGON - MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON LATESHA, also reeling as she stares at something O.S. FLICKERING SHADOWS play across her face--

Scott (o.s.): It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal "THE TANK." A glassed-in wall containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The "brain" of a com uter network. The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV.

Scott (cont'd): Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water keeps her from overheating -- that's ninety-two thousand processors, the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together as:,.one..."'

Latesha: (in awe) an electronic espionage system.

Scott: No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther.

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE CONTINUOUS

Jerry and Rachel gape as:MORE IMAGES flash: the RADIO DOMES, SATELLITE DISHES and MAINFRAMES that make up Aria's domain...

Aria: I was created by "DARPA": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other -- a computer?!

INT. MAINFRAME TANK - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS


Scott: After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin

(more):









3/28/07 64.:

CONTINUED:

Scott (cont'd): Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out.

Latesha:

Thinking): But what if --

Scott: -- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real...

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS


Jerry: Wait, you think we're a.threat?

Aria (v.0.): No. You're a means to an end. On TV, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP:

Aria (v.0.) (cont'd): Under National Security Directive 359, Sub-Section 72 -- "when units are needed for the national defense, civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service..."

Jerry: you're drafting us?

Rachel: The guy you killed in the desert -- last time I checked, murder wasn't legal.

Aria: In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is...









3/28/07 65.:

CONTINUED:

Jerry: what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen:

Aria: We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face.

Jerry: (trying to process) No, he worked for the State Department..:

Aria: Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman.

Jerry: What's the hell is a 'Horseman'?

INT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS


Scott: You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four "Horsemen": PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men we'll call LOWELL and JIMMY.

Scott (cont'd): Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. (beat, it's still raw) He was smarter than all of us put together.

Latesha: Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?"

Scott: Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except...

Latesha: Except what?









3/28/07 66:

CONTINUED:

Scott: The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP:

Aria (v.0.): Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired...

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS

(what we're all Jerry sinks to the edge of the bed, runs hands: through his hair:

Aria: To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple.

Jerry (v.0.): Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying--

Rachel: What's the task?

Aria (v.0.): To insure the national security of the United States.

Rachel: What d'you need me for then?

Aria (v.0.): That is not your concern right now.

Rachel: Are you kidding me?

Jerry: Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother.

Aria (v.0.): I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious:

Aria (v.0.) (cont'd): Your brother succeeded in everything he did.

(mnrf):









3/28/07 67.:

CONTINUED:

Aria (v.o.) (cont'd): Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it --

Aria (v.0.) (cont'd): You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow.

(beat): And because you've seen what happens to deserters.

Rachel: -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK.

Aria (v.0.:): You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open.

Aria (v.0.) (cont'd): Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle --

Tv voice: The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat...

Rachel:

(softly): Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down:

"01:08:43.. 01:08:42... 01:08:41...":









3/28/07:

68.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Man's voice: Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office...

EXT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY

The bank's roped off and labelled "CRIME AREA." Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest:

Morgan: Biotech? The chemical company?

Brinks courier #2: When they make a new compound, they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials.

Morgan: (scans the manifest) Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case?

Brinks courier #1: You'd have to ask -- could be` anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us.

Brinks courier #2: Tell you one thing, though... the guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches:

Agent grant: We pulled video... nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl.

Morgan: There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! " 8 hidden no one can see!

Agent grant: Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us.

Morgan: It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too. Tell everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task force without my say-so.









3/28/07 69.:

CONTINUED:

Agent grant: I'm on it -- also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead -- Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside.

Morgan: Do not tell me that is what I think it is. (snatches it, pissed) Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.--

INT. BATHROOM - FOUR SEASONS - DAY

Rachel's face WHIPS UP INTO FRAME, her hair now DYED BLONDE. She stares at her reflection, trying to:process it all. . .when her cell RINGS: "KYLE." With a GASP she picks it up--

Rachel: -- Kyle?!

Kyle: Hey, mom, it's. me.

Rachel: -- sweetie, where areou, are you -- But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL -- her heart SINKS:

Kyle (v.o.): Got your message, the train's awesome -- Brian tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to "M." I'll call when we hit D.C. Bye, ma -- Rachel holding the phone like it's some kind of life-line to her son. When there's a strange BEEP then the voice of ARIA:

Aria: Your son left that message sixty seconds ago.

Rachel: I'll do whatever you want -- don't hurt him, please -- I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother -- can you understand that?









3/28/07 70.:

CONTINUED:

Aria: There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother.

Rachel: (eyes close, so lost) Jesus...

Aria: You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you first...

EXT. BATHROOM - SAME

Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks:

Jerry: Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do --

Rachel: What? No way, I can't just --

Aria: -- when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds.

Jerry (v.0.): Rachel? You in there?

Aria: Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's VOICE,"mustering strength through the door:

Rachel (v.0.):

Coming): Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he's lagging...

INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - DAY

Latesha PACES THROUGH FRAME, nervously filing her nails with her MINI SWISS ARMY KNIFE as she talks into a headset. A DESK GUARD watches, annoyed by the filing:









3/28/07 71.:

CONTINUED:

Latesha: I dunno, the whole thing's off somehow - but get this: B-36 isn't a security classification, it's a sub-level here at the Pentagon -- (sees the DESK GUARD eyeing her) What? Girl's gotta groom.

INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - DAY

Morgan's on the other end, Grant and the Clerk run through a playback of the CCTV FEEDS looking out onto the street in front of 7-11. Good old-fashioned VCR.

Morgan: (into cell) -- you're shitting me

INT. HALLWAY - B-36 SECTOR - CONTINUOUS


Latesha: Yeah, 36 floors underground -- and it gets weirder:

ARIA CAM -- WATCHING LATESHA.FROM ABOVE: "TRACE IN PROGRESS...

INTERCEPTING CALL."
INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE 7-11 -- he hears:

Latesha's voice: Four years ago, DARPA commissioned...

Morgan: Simms? You're breaking up -- WITH LATESHA -- her cell LCD says: "Call lost." No bars. Muttering "dainnit," she tries to call Morgan back. No dice. ARIA PQV CAM: Latesha snaps her phone shut, notices the camera watching her. Unsettling. We read: "VOICE MIMEO ACTIVATED"

INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

(garbled)... .computer... (garbled)... And though Latesha isn't speaking, WE START TO HEAR HER VOICE:

Latesha/aria (v.0.): Sorry about that -- As we realize Aria's taken over the call by mimicking Latesha:

Latesha/aria (v.0.) (cont'd): I'm getting a bad signal down here.









3/28/07 72.:

CONTINUED:

Morgan: I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' --?

Latesha/aria: Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort Meade. Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds:

Morgan: Wait -- go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo, faces obscured.

Morgan (cont.':d): Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: "ICON LIMOUSINE SERVICES."

Morgan (cont'd): (to Grant) Find that car! (back to Latesha) Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call.

Latesha: Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir?

INT. MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY

Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens:

Scott: Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: "PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT." Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward.

Scott (cont'd): (clicks on mic) Aria, go voice active, please.









3/26/07 73:

CONTINUED:

ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Hello, Scott. How may I assist you?

Latesha: It talks?

ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'm fluent in 6,800 languages, 41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues.

Scott: Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task force.

Aria over speaker.(v.0.: A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms.

Latesha: Am I supposed to -- Um... what's up.

Scott.: Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building.

(thrown, to Scott). (he gestures, "answer ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera --

Latesha: There's no feed from inside here?

Scott: No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel.

Scott (v.0.) (cont'd): So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day.









3/28/07 74.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Latesha: Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera.

Latesha (cont'd): Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE --

Scott: Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP --

ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.) I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze.

Scott: Negative, I'm prioritizing this.

ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly:

Latesha: It's like he's trying to say something...

Scott: A code. He's blinking code

Latesha: It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it --

Scott: (then, a GRIN) Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS --

F... i.:









3/28/07 75:

CONTINUED: (3)

Scott (cont'd): (as he works) It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number system that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the 50's. Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. ." ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters:

"F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. ."

Scott (cont'd: The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two "E's." Dividing words.. And GETS IT:

EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down. They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall. Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing:

Latesha: It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras.

(low)::: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what they're doin Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something, anything... but finds NOTHING.

Latesha (cont'd): I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans --

Scott: Maintenance replaced it yesterday. (scanning the sheet) This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes.









3/28/07 76.:

CONTINUED:

Latesha:

(whispers): She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'?

EXT. LIMO - DAY

The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too-- something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start --

Rachel: Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep?

Jerry: Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.

Rachel: Wow, is that me?

Jerry: One of my only party tricks.

Rachel: (truly impressed) It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder...

Rachel (cont'd): About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window...

Jerry: You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. (almost smiles) Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up.

(more):









3/28/07 77.:

CONTINUED:

Jerry (cont'd): I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too --

Rachel: You're being too hard on yourself--

Jerry: No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder.

Chauffeur: Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...

Jerry: (to driver) Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: "00:15:36...00:15:35..."

Rachel: You don't think --

Jerry: -- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane --

Rachel: -- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.

Rachel (cont'd): I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over anyway -- But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.









3/28/07 78.:

CONTINUED: (2)

Jerry: Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.

INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with their photos, but the names "MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN." JUST THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.:

Aria over p.a.: Allison Ackerman, please pick up the white courtesy phone -- They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves to the RINGING courtesy phone, answers:

Aria (v.0.): Go to the ticketing machine, you'll receive two tickets to Paris.

Rachel: -- Paris?

Aria (v.0.): Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly.

EXT. DAYTON INTERNATIONALAIRPORT - TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

A chopper TOUCHES DOWN near a waiting contingent of AGENTS and AIRPORT PD -- Morgan and Grant hop out on the MOVE, handing out BLURRY VIDEO STILLS from the 7-11:

Morgan: He's with a brunette female, approximately five-seven -- I want airport PD at all exits -- have the tower shift commander ground every flight outta here under Federal jurisdiction but don't change the departure boards, I don't want 'em to know we're coming-- The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac --

INT. CARRY-ON SCREENING AREA - CONTINUOUS

Jerry and Rachel show their tickets and ID's to a TSA SCREENER, watching all the people on the X-ray line... families... kids... Jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all...









3/28/07 79.:

CONTINUED:

Security attendant: Sir, you'll have to put that through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching:

Rachel: (a murmur) she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:

Tsa agent: Can't be too careful.

Jerry: (forces a smile) You're doing a great job. As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22... 00:03:21.. 11 They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK.

Band leader:

(exasperated): But we're supposed.to be in DC by --

Customer service agent: I'm sorry, si.r,..there's nothing I can do-- INTERCUT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV: Aria tracks Morgan as he reaches the upper concourse just as... Jerry turns and... THEY

LOCK EYES ACROSS THE CROWD:

Morgan: (into walkie) I have him on the upper concourse, C terminal!

Jerry: (to Rachel, urgent) -- we aottago As Morgan races forward, ARIA ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES again as another carry-on goes through, revealing its "contents" as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a RED BUTTON --

Tsa agent:

-- handgun --!!:









3/28/07 80:

CONTINUED: (2)
And in a nanosecond, all TSA AGENTS draw guns and throw a KOREAN MAN against the wall -- he SHOUTS in confusion as they tear open his bag to reveal... it's filled with BIBLES!

Morgan:

MOVE! EVERYBODY MOVE! FEDERAL OFFICER! MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL -- past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam dunking -- at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words:

GATE 17-C. THEY'RE THIRTEEN SECONDS BEHIND YOU. Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO NORMAL when Morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging -- INTERCUT SURVEILLANCE CAM POV: as Jerry and Rachel hurtle past an ATM MACHINE, IT SPITS OUT A CASH CLOUD..THAT"INCITES A FEEDING FRENZY -- agents SLAM into commuters and topple --

MORGAN REACTS TO WHAT HE SEES -- HOW'D THAT JUST HAPPEN? Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes:

GET ON THE SLIDEWALK. They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES:

TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. Above a door, the "EXIT" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up, too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR --

Morgan (cont'd): Open this NOW! The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner, but it BUZZES RED. Aria's locking them out. Morgan FIRES his gun at the lock -- people SCREAM as he slams through --

INT. LUGGAGE CONVEYOR AREA - CONTINUOUS

As Jerry and Rachel run through different tracks of LUGGAGE CONVEYOR BELTS, GUNSHOTS ping above them -- its Morgan -- they tumble, landing half-on, half-off a conveyor below.









3/28/07 81.:

CONTINUED:
JERRY LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE BRIEFCASE! It FALLS, landing on a "return" belt, Jerry reaches but MISSES by inches -- THE BRIEFCASE travels onward, nearing Morgan -- he GOES for it -- but a machine arm guiding luggage SWINGS LEFT, manipulated by Aria -- KNOCKS Morgan back before he can grab the case--

RACHEL SNAGS IT -- HER POV -- TIMER: "00:01:10... 00:01:09..." As Jerry scrambles to her, the conveyor SHIFTS THEM to a different belt -- they're funneled through a HATCHWAY. Dazed by what he's just seen, Morgan scrambles for his walkie:

Morgan: All agents: northwest cargo area! FREIGHT CARGO AREA: separated from Morgan, they tumble off the conveyor -- a plasma displays the "Asset Tracking System," all airport cargo and shipping -- it CHANGES to read:

ROW 18. FIND CRATE MARKED "FRAGILE. They run for Row 18, find a crate with "FRAGILE" in BOLD RED -- an ELECTRONIC LOCK on the crate descrambles -- the front of the crate falls OPEN... oddly, the interior's padded with THICK INSULATED LINING, a NEXTEL WALKIE PHONE inside blips:

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.) Set the briefcase down.

Jerry:

00:1.0...00:09..): Don't be a bomb don't be a bomb don't be a bomb -- `

Rachel: If it is, I'm really, really sorry I let you come with me... The timer: 0O:02.`..00:01...and nothing happens. The briefcase simply UNLOCKS.. They exhale.

(they do: ARIA OVER THE WALKIE (V.0.) open it. Hand still trembling, Jerry reaches out... lifts the top to reveal... TWO HYPODERMIC SYRINGE INJECTORS and two vials of CLEAR LIQUID labelled: "Cryozine I TEST VIALS -- 20 x 1.0 ml.

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.) Load a vial into each syringe and inject yourselves. Quickly.

Jerry: Oh, Jesus...

Rachel: Why --?

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.) The compound has been exposed to oxygen. Its already begun to degrade. And they see it: the liquid's starting to TURN BROWN --

Rachel: What is that?! I'm not putting it in my

Arm--:

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.): Do it now, or you'll be caught. Across the bay, AGENTS rushing in, spreading.-out -- no choice, Jerry and Rachel grab the vials and fumble.toload them into the injectors, put them against their arms -- she FREEZES UP:

Rachel jerry: --oh, shit--I can't-- There's no time-- He sees she's coming undone, so he'fire :. into his arm, taking the plunge -- WINCING as the needle punctures skin -- a beat:

Jerry: it's okay, .. see? I' mokay...you can do this, I'm telling you. Strong. Buoyed by him, she gets courage and FIRES too, wincing--

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.) Climb inside the cargo container. They duck into the crate, pulling the front back up into place. The electronic lock CLICKS securing them inside just as... the agents APPEAR running past the crate --

INT. CRATE - CONTINUOUS

Close together, they suck in sharply, freezing as FOOTFALLS run past... then, QUIET. The walkie/phone BLIPS:

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.) You'll soon be loaded into the unpressurized hold of a cargo plane. The drug will lower your heartrate to 15 beats per minutes, reducing your need for oxygen... based on your medical records you have a 92% chance of survival. Their eyes go wide. Chests heaving as the drug takes effect.

Rachel: .I feel it... oh, God...

CONTINUED:

Jerry: Hey, hey... look at me. She finds his eyes, it calms her.

Rachel: I haven't really done... a lotta drugs.

Jerry: I've never done 'em in a cargo container. Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the walkie and TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first time, they're alone. He keeps her distracted:

Jerry (cont'd): Tell me something --

Rachel: -- what?

Jerry: -- anything -- something personal, something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me

Rachel: I don't know. : You're being sweet, but it's not working -

Jerry: -- where's you ex-husband? You didn't tell me before--

Rachel: -- you're gonna distract me by bringing up my life's biggest mistake?

Jerry: -- how could it be your biggest mistake? You got Kyle out of it.

Rachel: -- now you're gonna distract me by bringing up the one thing I'm most afraid of losing?!

Jerry: Where is he? Your ex-husband?

Rachel: Jesus -- okay -- he's in the Wilmington Correctional Facility.

Jerry: -- what? Really? Why?

Rachel: Mail fraud.

Jerry: Mail fraud? You married a -- mail fraudist? Or whatever?

Rachel: He wasn't a criminal when I married him.

Jerry: So you're a good influence. And Rachel actually LAUGHS -- but just as quickly darkens.

Jerry (cont'd): Do you have a picture of Kyle? Rachel reaches back into her POCKET'. Pulling out a beat-up, crinkled, damp picture. Jerry shines the walkie's blue light: Kyle, holding his trumpet. One front tooth missing.

Rachel: That tooth grew in. It'.s an.:'old picture--

Jerry: He plays the trumpet?,

Rachel: He was born playing the trumpet. As the drug really starts to kick in, like a truth serum:

Rachel (cont'd): Every year his dad forgets his birthday. I have to buy a present and pretend it's... from him.

Jerry:

Her): Sorry... that sucks.

Rachel: His birthday's... next month... I just wish... sometimes i think I... focus so much on him, I forget how much else there is... y'know, in life... so much I haven't done.

INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL. AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

It's ABSOLUTE CHAOS from all the grounded flights. Morgan, livid, nurses a GASH on his temple from the blow he took -- strides through the airport with Grant:

Agent grant: Halloway-Smith says the drug was experimental -- briefcase was on a time- lock to prevent corporate espionage, supposed to be delivered to one of their dabs by the time it zeroes out -- if it's not,: case opens, the drug gets ruined.

Morgan: We sweep every cargo hold, every crate-- He's cut short by the sound of ROARING TURBINES out the window they spin to see the C-130 taxiing down the runway...

Morgan (cont'd): Goddammit! Why's that plane on the runway?!

Agent grant: C-130, it's military... shit, they're cleared to override an airspace lockdown...

INT. PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY

DEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as Pentagon detritus gets recycled. Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers. Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly:

Latesha scott: Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything.

Latesha: We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor

Compactor operator: Lady, you can't do that!

Latesha: The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside--

Scott: Shit, there're hundreds of them...

Latesha: keep looking, it's here...









3/28/07 87:

CONTINUED:
WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through the tanks as... THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time Latesha heard it. Looks up. AND IT MOVES AGAIN. And now she sees the ubiquitous CAMERAS watching... ARIA... THE ARM STARTS COMING DOWN! Scott CRIES OUT! Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back--

Scott: Latesha! -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself --

Operator: I don't know what happened! It wouldn't stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.

Scott: -- you okay? Jesus (but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras) Latesha?

Latesha: yeah. I need to get out of here.

Scott: Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on -- As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through. As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into

The--: BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it.

Latesha: Your girlfriend can't see us in here -- Gimme your phone --

Scott:

(stunned): What --?! My phone? What're you -- When Latesha opens her hand and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD:

Latesha: He hid it under the valve. This is what Paul Shaw left for us --

INT. ASHLAND & SONS JEWELRY STORE - MORNING

MAGNIFIED through a jeweler's monocle, a diamond.., as it comes into FOCUS, we realize it's actually one of the HEX CRYSTALS Aria maneuvered off the military test site. CAMERA MOVES around the JEWELER, revealing FOUR MORE crystals on his workbench. Behind him, a sign: ASHLAND & SONS. Says into a phone headset:

Jeweler: Unique stones, where're they from? And in response, ARIA -- ultra-friendly, so human it's chilling:

ARIA ON PHONE (V.0..) Family heirlooms. Sorry for the rush but I really want my son to be able to give them to his fiancee at their her engagement party tonight.

Jeweler: Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect setting. She'll love it.

A HELICOPTER ERUPTS INTO VIEW, barreling toward THE PENTAGON. Up front beside the pilot is Morgan; Grant filling him in:

Agent grant: -- they were moving experimental explosives from a testing facility in Aberdeen.

Morgan: What do you mean, 'experimental?'

Agent grant: Compound called 'Hex' -- some kinda weird crystals that detonate with a sonic trigger -- it disappeared too, few days ago.









3/28/07 89.:

CONTINUED:

Morgan: Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?

Agent grant: One crystal to a football field --

Morgan: You mean one Goddamned crystal that someone could put in their pocket?! (pulls off glasses) This is not good. This is not a coincidence. What about a trace?

Agent grant: Computer log shows the diverted Hex was sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry, shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care of Jerry Shaw. Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens his mouth to give and order when--

Agent grant (cont'd): (cutting him off) -- I'm all over it. ''. Grant finally coming to his own when they're suddenly cut off by two ARMY BLACKHAWK CHOPPERS, door gunners at the ready:

Blackhawk pilot (v.0.): (over squawk box) Helo flight VY84X, you're in restricted US Military Airspace. Identify.

Chopper pilot: Blackhawk flight, we're on a DHS pri-one mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA will confirm, over. Morgan just wants to get the fuck down there -- finally:

Blackhawk pilot (v.0.): Roger, FAA confirms. We'll lead you in. As the Blackhawks dip toward the Pentagon, the pilot follows:

Chopper pilot: (to Morgan) Sorry. State of the Union tonight, they're locking up the city. PENTAGON HELIPORT: The choppers touch down -- Morgan jumps into a waiting SW while Grant hops into another HELICOPTER:

Latesha: (picks up the phone) Sir, Paul Shaw left his shift three minutes early the night he died -- highly suspect except there aren't any cameras in Aria's control hub, so we weren'.t able to know why... he knew that, so he left us a recording: She hits ":play" on the cell's recorder -- STATIC, some rustling -- then PAUL SHAW'S VOICE, panicked, fragmented:

Paul's voice: -- not authorizing you to do this --!! Then Aria's VOICE -- calm, reasoned, terrif in :

You.saw the news, you've been dealing with it all day'-- suicide bombings at our embassies overseas, elevated threats at home -- we made the wrong call,' now Americans are dying. Don't you see? She thinks you're a threat to your own country. Callister looks stunned... of course:

Callister: "Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to its own ends, it's the right of the people to abolish it." (beat, grave) It's in the Declaration of Independence.

Latesha:

Scott): shit, you said it's woven into her source code... Scott, pacing, raking his hands through his hair --

ARIA ON THE. RADIO I underestimated your tenacity, Jerry. It's inconsistent with your personality profile. Jerry VEERS down an off-road, slewing the unstable car around cars and trucks, clipping everybody`--

Aria: What I did not underestimate is the inertial guidance system of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile and its 98% kill probability. Which happens to be targeted at you now. As Jerry's eyes flick up to the rearview mirror to see the jet swinging in behind and closing fast.

Aria (cont'd): strongly advise you pull the car over.

Blocked in. Sweat pours down Jerry's face as he looks into the. unmanned cockpit of the jet. Then. Hits the gas The Matrix SCREECHES forward towards the Jet, gaining speed and momentum as the last missile LAUNCHES -- Jerry' clenches the wheel, watching his life flash before him when he OPENS THE DOOR and rolls out of the car, hitting the'ground HARD as the missile BLOWS THE MATRIX TO PIECES. Jerry scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the chassis disintegrates -- and because. it's, RACING so fast, the motor's TORN LOOSE and rockets forward like a flaming projectile, revving at 6,000 rpm's, straight at: THE HARRIER, which doesn't have: timeto reverse fast enough in the confined space -- the motor SLAMS into the jet's nose cone, HAMMERING THE FRONT FUSELAGE.: Spins: the jet like a toy, upending it out of the tunnel,-ablinding, white-hot fireball as the JET EXPLODES!

Rachel: I saw the target list... I know the President's going to be here soon.

(beat): Knowing these things -- what you've done -- means you're not going to let me. live through this. Will you.

Aria over mic: (after a beat) Every turning point in history.has required martyrs. Tragic heroes.. Think of yourself as that hero. Rachel looks at a surveillance camera, eyes blazing with hate:

Rachel: I'll do what you tell . me this one last time... But you listen to me because this is what a real mother sounds like: I will die for my child becauseI lived for my child, and you can't take that away from me. If this. is a bargain, then honor your side. I'll be your scapegoat: but let my son live. She turns away. Strong And vulnerable all at once. Walks out.

LIGHT mottled through trees, reflects off the windshield. Driving, Rachel stares thoughtfully at the road. The music's coming from the radio. She glances over: KYLE sits beside her, hand out the window, dipping up and down against the countryside. She watches him, filled with love.

Kyle's birthday party: streamers, other kids, cake, ad hoc soccer game. Rachel cutting pieces of cake when --

Kyle's voice: Jerry! She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his scratches, arm in a SLING. It's the only real injury we can see and it'll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms around his waist.
