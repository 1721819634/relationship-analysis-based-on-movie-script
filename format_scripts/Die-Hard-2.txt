1 EXT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 1

JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD" sign on the rear window.

Mcclane: I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's just let her down nice and easy -

Cop: Sure. At the impound lot.

(pointing): Next time, read the sign.

Mcclane: You don't understand, I'm just meeting my wife's-plane - you gotta give me this car back.

Cop: Sure. Tomorrow 8 to four, you pay 40 bucks, we give it back.

Mcclane: This is my mother in law's car. She already hates me because I'm not a

2 INT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 2

CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic voices. McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out of sight from the public.

Mcclane 1st newscaster: Telephones? (on TV) .and that White Christmas INFORMATION GIRL may be here for a while, if Right over there. to the Metro area this afternoon as predicted. McClane nods, serves across the slick linoleum.

I: A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg chains is hustled aboard a plane.

2nd newscaster: Security was tight today at Escalon airport in the Republic of Val Verde, where government authorities escorted General Ramon Esperanza to the military transport that will bring him to the United States to stand trial for narcotics trafficking. A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching and curling oddly.

6 wider 6: A half naked MAN is doing Tai Ch'i EXERCISES. This is COLONEL WILLIAM STUART, U.S.A. (Ret.) His body is hard, with SCARS from knives and bullets. On the TV, the words "FILE TAPE" blink under Esperanza's IMAGE,. here resplendent in a Latin American uniform, reviewing troops in the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign documents with American military officers. He hands a COLONEL the pen just used on the document - a souvenir.

HOLLY MCCLANE is here, AirPhone at her ear and a beautiful SUNSET over the plane's wing visible through the nearby window. With the Compaq portable computer, filofax and calculator piled on it, Holly'.s seat back table looks like a traveling office.

Mcclane: Hello. This is Lieutenant McClane - Somebody there beep me?

Holly: I'd like to think I'm somebody.

Mcclane: Holly! Did you land?

Holly: John, wake up. It's the nineties. Microchips, microwaves, faxes and airphones.

17 A LITTLE SEMI-RURAL CHURCH - NEAR THE AIRPORT 17 Charming until the SUB WOOFER ROAR of a big jet SCREAMS by, practically in the little church's backyard. Now we notice that the church is a little run down - trim needing paint, sidewalk cracked - and a neat SIGN confirms our

"FUTURE SITE OF PARISH DAY CARE CENTER.

WORSHIP WITH US AT OUR NEW CHURCH,

52 KENSINGTON ROAD, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA." A DWP VAN pulls up, snow tires CRUNCHING on the driveway here. Two MEN (BAKER and THOMPSON) get out in official DWP wardrobe. But we remember the trim bodies, trimmer hair... and we remember those gift wrapped packages, - which one of these guys carries.

18 INSIDE THE CHURCH 18 On a TV here, the newscast CONTINUES, now back to the tropical airport. Esperanza is at the top of the steps, waving to the press like a triumphant hero - not a felon en route to prison. The plane doors close and it taxis down the runway.

Lorenzo: In an airport Christmas week? You gotta be kidding.

Mcclane: Okay. Forget the courtesy. How about lust the professional? Your boys dust walked away from a crime scene - you need to seal it off, get a forensics team in, dust it, shoot

Mcclane': Why don't you try it and find out?

F lorenzo: Because I don't need a forensics investigation to file away some punk stealing luggage -

Mcclane: Luggage? That "punk" pulled a Glock Seven on me. Know what that is? A porcelain gun from Germany. It doesn't show up on airport x-ray machines... and it costs more than you earn in a month.

Lorenzo: You'd be surprised what I earn in a month.

Mcclane: If it's more than a dollar eighty nine, yeah -

Lorenzo:

Just 'cause the TV thought you were hot shit don't make it so. This time you're in my little pond, and I'm the big fish that runs it. Now you capped some lowlife, fine.

McClane comes out of Lorenzo's office, steaming. He walks down the corridor - looks back at one of the stocky Airport cops -fakes a smile - when the guy turns away McClane punches the wall.

That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground.

Mcclane: Anybody try and fix the deck tonight? (on his look) Anything weird going on besides the shooting?

Stuart: This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled.

95 FAVORING MCCLANE 95 As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over to Barnes.

Mcclane: What's all that about?

Barnes: A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we've got here. Take out the seats and save some weight, add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia, Africa, Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world.'

Mcclane: Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties.

Lorenzo: They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport

With a cordless drill, Marvin unhinges the access door. Last bolt, it falls with a sheet-metal SLAM. McClane WINCES as a BLAST of AIR hits him - and, as. perspiration breaks out on his forehead, we realize it's hot air.

Mcclane: Whoa.

Marvin: Winter up there... Summer down here. He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what he sees. He turns, takes Marvin's map.

Mcclane(cont'd): I owe you one, Marvin. How about a sixpack of malt liquor?

Marvin: How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker? (on McClane's look) Hey, I may be homeless, but I ain't tasteless.

There's a scary moment at first but he gets quickly confident - a bit too ; 7-7 confident midway - he starts to lose his balance and all-but runs to the far end, JUMPS to safety. As he pulls himself up he HEARS Marvin CLAPPING behind him. With a scowl, McClane checks his map, pushes on.

Holly: Yeah. There's quite a few out there; we're in a regular traffic jam.

Thornberg: There's nothing regular about it.

Garber: You were right... they went for the antenna array. We're right on schedule.

Stuart: Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals.

Stuart: Attention, Dulles. You were warned not to try and restore your systems.

Stuart: McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though...

Mcclane: Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?

Stuart: I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression.

Mcclane: And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb?

Stuart: I think we can find something in between. (aside, off mike) Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to another mike (or frequency).

210 THE TUNNEL 210 BLAM! BLAM! McClane shoots off the lock apparatus of the grid! A RICOCHET PINGS off one of the grids hydraulic hinges and McClane winces as metal splinters sail by. Then he begins to muscle the heavy grid upwards.

211 UP ABOVE 211 A FIELD of SNOW and ICE. But now a BLACK RECTANGLE EMERGES from it - it's the TUNNEL GRID, SNOW falling through it - the damn thing must weight over 300 pounds - McClane gets his head and shoulders up and out. Looks at -

218 MCCLANE AND PLANE - IN ONE SHOT 218 It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel. Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.

AND THE PLANE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE. McClane DIVES OUT OF THE HOLE.

219 NEW ANGLE 219 McClane rolls away from the wheels, which miss him by inches. The PLANE SMACKS into the half-open grid, which goes FLYING, the plane hardly dented, the rifle SNAPPING like a toothpick, the scrambler CRUNCHING like a bug McClave kisses asphalt, WINCES at the SCORCH of jet exhaust five feet over his head.

Esperanza: No. NcClane 'DIVES and rolls into the cabin - FIRES TWICE out the door and then almost on instinct whirls - Esperanza's snatched up the rifle from the dead corporal but (X) McClane's SHOT hits him in the SHOULDER. With a HOWL, Esperanza falls backwards but hangs on to the gun.

413 stuart 413: in the doorway, tries to AIM - but

414 THE TWO MEN - STRUGGLING ON THE WING 414 are INDISTINGUISHABLE in the driving snow.

415 MCCLANE AND GRANT 415 Each HOLDING ON TO THE WING with one hand - FIGHTING with the other - Grant POUNDS AWAY on McClane's face - but McClane doesn't HIT BACK - he just GRINS like a maniac - PUSHES Grant -pushes -pushes -

Grant:

They struggle): Too - bad - McClane - The SOUND of metal SLIDING - a KNIFE APPEARS in Grant's hand-

Grant(cont'd):

(raising knife): I really liked you -

416 grant 416: too late, he realizes he's over the front edge of the wing! He screams and FALLS -

(through his teeth, as 417 NEW ANGLE 417 RIGHT INTO THE ENGINE INTAKE! There's an awful GRINDING SOUND -A SCREAM - McClane winces as RED SNOW SPLATTERS HIM -

418 REAR OF ENGINE 418 it could be hamburger pouring out - but before we can dwell on it, the engine pod BLOWS!

18A MCCLANE - ON THE WING 418A wipes red snow from his arm.

3:

Mcclane: I like you better dead.

419 IN THE COCKPIT 419 a "FIRE" indicator goes on. Esperanza hits "EXTINGUISHER", handles it - increases power to the other engines.

420 stuart 420: trying-to SEE - finally - a GLIMPSE of what has to be McClane -with a savage grin, Stuart takes off his rifle - discards the bulky coat - knife in hand, he steps out.

421 mcclane 421: moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing. Looks over and down at

422 FUEL PORT - UPSIDE DOWN - HIS POV 422









-423 BACK TO SCENE 423 He reaches for it. Too far. Stretches. Gets it - fucker is TIGHT. Wincing, he TURNS it a bit - then LOOKS up just in TIME to SEE STUART, knife whizzing DOWN -

424 NEW ANGLE 424 McClane ROLLS, but the knife CATCHES his SHOULDER. In pain, he manances to KICK Stuart's KNEE - Stuart FALLS, almost goes over the wing - McClane goes back to work on the fuel port -it,TURNS another 1/4 turn -and then he has to abandon it to deal with another CHARGE from Stuart.

425 esperanza 425: he TURNS the PLANE. Now he's ON THE RUNWAY PROPER.

426 MCCLANE AND STUART 426 FIGHTING for the knife. With.all his strength, McClane JAMS Stuart's knife hand the aerilon crack! The next WIGGLE of the metal CRUNCHES both hand and knife! Stuart SCREAMS and loosens his grip on McClane, who PUNCHES him away, goes back to work on the fuel port! But he's hardly at it when Stuart RECOVERS, and, mangled hand held clawlike, KICKS McClane's INJURED SHOULDER -KICKS AGAIN -blood on Stuart's shoe - McClane is being worked over the edge of the wing! He CATCHES at the last moment - now he IGNORES Stuart's BLOWS, because -

427 UNDER THE WING 427 .McClane feels for the fuel port - turn, turn - it OPENS! Fuel SPIGOTS DOWN - McClane feels the wetness on his hand -

428 THE RUNWAY 428 a RIBBON of FUEL twists behind the moving plane, slick and light

Reflecting -:

429 BACK TO SCENE 429 Stuart STOMPS on McClane's HANDS on the wing - CRUNCH -STOMPS again - McClane SMILES -and then Stuart KICKS HIM OFF THE WING!

430 mcclane 430: DROPS 20 FEET, SLAMS into the snow at the edge of the runway, bounces like litter thrown from a moving car - the big REAR TIRE almost rolls over him -

431 stuart 431: with a victorious SHOUT he YANKS the coat from the aerilon, throws it away - heads for the door -









112:

432 esperanza 432: sees this, smiles -

433 MCCLANE -AT EDGE OF RUNWAY 433 crawls to a painful sitting position. Face impassive, he watches the jet move away... and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a cigarette, looks off at - (X)

I:

434 THE LINE OF JET FUEL 434 running along the runway for 1/4 mile now -

435 mcclane 435: battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark sky trying to find the SOUND OF JET ENGINES. Then he SEES -

436 LIGHTS OF HOLLY'S PLANE - HIS POV 436 careening down in a desperate fight, against gravity -

437 BACK TO SCENE 437 1 McClave takes a LONG PULL on the cigarette until the tip is

Red-hot.:

438 STUART - IN THE OPEN PLANE DOORWAY 438 about to close it, he looks back and for the first time SEES

439 THE JET FUEL - HIS POV 439 winding endlessly down the runway -

440 mcclane 440:

Mcclane: Hey, Colonel: Happy Fucking New Year. And he THROWS THE CIGARETTE INTO THE FUEL.

441 stuart 441: SEES the flame RACING TOWARDS HIM - turns to SHOUT to Esperanza -

Stuart:

NO! NO! TAKE OFF! TAKE OFF NOW! (X)

442 ESPERANZA - IN COCKPIT 442 RESPONDS to the cry, GUNS IT - (X)

442A THE PLANE 442A STARTS TO-RISE - the wheels go into the AIR - (X)









113:

(x): j j42B REAR OF PLANE 442B But as the craft rises, so does the FLAME, climbing the fuel ribbon RIGHT INTO THE SKY and TO THE NEAREST ENGINE which

Explodes!:

442c esperanza 442c: TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE

And then:

443 stuart 443: is BLOWN TO LITTLE PIECES as a FIREBALL BLOWS RIGHT OUT THE DOOR., taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then

444 THE PLANE - LONG SHOT 444 It EXPLODES ITSELF, WINGS and TAIL and BODY going nine different directions!

445 omitted 445:

446 mcclane 446: DIVES for the ground as the explosion ROLLS TOWARDS HIM.

447 IN THE CAB 4471 they watch the FIREBALL in the distance -

448 mcclane 448: Gets to his knees, and LOOKS at the huge conflagration.

Mcclane: (towards the sky) Honey... there's your landing lights.

CUT TO:

449 INT. HOLLY'S PLANE - COCKPIT 449

Blackness and driven SNOW outside - and then - in an almost cinematic FADE - through the glass we SEE the BURNING WRECKAGE -and, more importantly - the LINE OF FIRE RUNNING CLEAN AND STRAIGHT for almost a mile - A line right along the runway.

Co-pilot: Look - ! The pilot grabs controls desperately, trims the plane -









114:

450 IN THE CABIN - 450 The passengers REACT as they level a bit -

CUT TO:

451 EXT. HER PLANE 451

It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's ALONGSIDE the line of fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the wheels BOUNCE, once, twice, and then a tire BLOWS but the pilots (X) HOLD IT as it SWERVES and finally SKIDS TO A HALT, turning onto (X) the grassy field. Already we HEAR RESCUE SIRENS.

452 IN THE CAB 452

Barnes: (listening to headset) One forty is down! They used the fire to see -

(laughing): I -they used the fucking fire to see!

An engineer: They can all do that - let's tell

'em -:

Trudeau: They already know. Listen. And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -

453 EXT. SKY - LANDING PATTERN 453

And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to the size of stars.

454 MCCLANE - ON THE RUNWAY 454 Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming... IGNORING the giant PLANE LANDING BESIDE HIM, ignoring the FLAMES beyond that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now another giant PLANE SKIDS down behind him - it's an assembly line, like B-29's coming home from war - then he SEES what he's praying for - breaks into a RUN -

Mcclane: Holly - HOLLY -HOLLY!

455 HOLLY - IN PLANE DOOR 455 HEARS this just as she goes down the RESCUE CHUTE, ushed by Stewardess controlling their own tears -









115:

(x):

('.. 456 MCCLANE 456 CATCHES her at the bottom like a child - CARRIES HER AWAY.

457 THORNBERG - ON THE GROUND 457 groggy, he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess. She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off.

CUT TO:

458 THE NEWS 'CHOPPER 458 It CRUNCHES DOWN on the frozen earth near the runway. Sam and her cameraman hit the ground running. SEE -

459 MCCLANE AND HOLLY 459 embracing - and then she's nursing his wounds, hearing his story-

460 BACK TO SCENE 460 The cameraman brings up his lens.

Cameraman: God, that's beautiful -

Sam: Yeah. It sure is. And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily.

461 THE AIRFIELD - NIGHT 461 as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones.

461a mcclane 461a: Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both TURN at a HONK. Marvin is there in an airport cart. He looks at the chaos.

Marvin: Damned if I'm cleaning up this mess. McClane and Holly get in the cart. Marvin drives them away, light BLINKING... and we PULLBACK until McClane and Holly are just part of the crowd.

The end:
