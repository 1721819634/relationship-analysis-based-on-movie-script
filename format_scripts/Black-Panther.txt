EXT. DEEP SPACE

A dark screen is lit up by twinkling stars .

Son: Baba?

Father: Yes, my son?

Son: Tell me a story .

Father: Which one?

Son: The story of home . A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off in the distance.

Father: Millions of years ago , a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it.

The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals affected by vibranium.

Father (cont'd): And when the time of man came , five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength , speed, and instincts.


A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite the tribes .

Father (cont'd): The warrior became King and the first Black Panther , the protector of Wakanda .

(more):

2.:

Father (cont'd): Four tribes agreed to live under the King's rule , but the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains.

We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain region.

Father (cont'd): The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation , but as Wakanda thrived the world around it descended further into chaos.

We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda ' s secretive border .

Father (cont'd): To keep vibranium safe , the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight, keeping the truth of their power from the outside world.

We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city , as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on another part of the world ..·

Son: And we still hide Baba?

Father: Yes .

Son: Why?

T'challa: What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .

Nakia: Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it ... other countries do it, we do it better.

T' challa: We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life.

Nakia: Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time . Nakia gives T'Challa a look .

T'challa: If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.

W'kabi (cont'd): Now, if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world , then I'd be all for it.

T'challa: But waging war on other countries has never been our way . Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.

T'challa: Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one . Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.

Shur!: (pointing at the necklace) Now tell it to go on. T'Challa does, and without warning, MILLIONS of vibranium laced NANITES spill from the necklace and form a new BLACK PANTHERSUIT around the mannequin.

Shur! (cont'd): Oooh! ! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace . Strike it .

T'challa: Anywhere?

T'Challa turns to the mannequin in a relaxed fighting stance . Shuri nods and T' Challa SPIN KICKS the shit out of the mannequin!

Shur! (cont'd): Not that hard, genius!

T'challa: You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot .

Shur!: I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around .

37 .:





T'challa: Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script .

T'challa (cont'd): Wait a minute .

Shuri: The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribu t ion .

T'challa: Very nice.

Shuri: Now strike it again , in the same spot . T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her Kimoyo . T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously .

Mine.: Suddenly an AUTOMATED MINING CART whips between light panels, floating above a rail .

Shur!: Sonic stabilizers .

Killmonger: Not your own? But didn't life start here , on this continent? So ain ' t all people your people?

T'challa: I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you.

Killmonger:

(laughing): That's not my name , Princess . Ask me, King?

T'challa: No.

Killmon:

Bordertribe elder: As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights .

Ramonda: He has no rights here.

River tribe elder: The challenge would take weeks to prepare .

Killmonger: Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him ... and somebody to get me out of these chains.

I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world.
