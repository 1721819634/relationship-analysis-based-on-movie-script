FADE IN:

OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL)

A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back part of a sign.

Narrator: To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order.

4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed:

Wï¿½LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL

THE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS

FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5

1914, population 2682:

STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _

Dutch: Make you feel welcome?

Pike:

(dryly): It helps..

Tec tor: What's it say?

Angel: (baiting him) It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read.

Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike.

Tector: I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid.

Angel: Nor I with dogs.

Dutch: (grinning at Pike) ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks.

Pike: (t0 Teotor and Angel) Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON Aï¿½M BOXCARS into a side street.

EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY


THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside.

Speaker (os): Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.

Speaker (os) (contid):

(then): That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.-

Congregation (os): I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same.

AS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS, ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS,

BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME.

10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE

SALOON. AT Tï¿½- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them. 1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square. Some passersby look curiously.

Pike:

Awkwardly): Fall in -- and follow me. The men,. with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle into a ragged column of twos.

FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious- ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector and Phil stay with the horses.

PIKE AND DUTCH, LOOKING AROUND AS THEY LEAVE. THE BOARDWALK,

ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE.

Pike: (removing his hat) Beg pardon, Ma'am.

Dutch: (as she stops) Let. me, Ma'am. Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm. She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the others, lead her across the 'street.

16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE

TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them. on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long time, and they are tired.

17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL-

ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall, Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he has lived is still. intact.

Harrigan:

(harshly): The soldiers sit up -- take a look! Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a little.

Harrigan: Pike?

Thorn ton: (after a long moment) He's there. The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- â¢ing, ready to fire..

Harrigan:

(hissing): Hold your fire; -- We wait till they come out -- catch them in the act. (to Thornton) Then.you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward him, his.face white, remembering-

Harr igan: That's all we needed:

INT. PAY OFFICE - DAY


23 THE PAYMASTER IS REPRIMANDING A CLERK.

Paymaster: What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means. military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw their\guns and Pike steps towards him.

Paymaster: (reaching for air) What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip!)

Pike: If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at:

BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces.

SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in his. direction, then freeze as: 31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders.

32 IN THE PAY OFFICE -- ANGEL CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AS THE NOISE FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi:: 3.3 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE LOADING SACKS OF SILVER into their saddle bags.

Pike: (after a moment) No. You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts.

C.l.: 111-1 hold 'am till hell freezes over or you say different ! Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him, hesitates., looks. at C.L., then continues to . the door, grabs the handle, looks back again.

ON THE ROOF -- THE BOUNTY HUNTERS OPEN FIRE AS THE DOOR FLIES

OPEN AND THE PAYMASTER STUMBLES OUT INTO THE STREET INTO THE MIDST OF THE BAND,. screaming as the gunfire cuts him down. The marchers are frozen for a brief instant, then scatter in terror as:

The following scenes will be superimposed over 101 and 102. The suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very plush indeed, TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL-YOUNG WOMEN in revealing night dress are hindering more than helping, a somewhat loaded Pike Bishop as he attempts to get into his clothes. The ladies are giggling. and there is a great deal of grab-ass between the three. - 101-B THORNTON, fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big city clothes, enters from one of. the adjoining rooms. ELIZABETH, a tall, lovely near-naked,.dark-haired girl, follows him and takes his arm possessively. For a moment both watch: 101-C PIKE'S girls'effectively stop his half-hearted attempts and begin disrobing him.

Thornton:

(sharply): Come on pardner, let's get out of here. -

Pike: You.sound like you're all caught up,

Thornton: Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcomes

Pike: (Suddenly angry) What in hell is the matter with you?

The Deputy moves into the room (followed by three other men) and fires at Pike but misses, as. 101-F PIKE SLIPS PAST the screaming women into an adjoining room. The other men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and snaps Thornton's wrists together with handcuffs. The sound: of gunfire is heard from the street outside, then two of the men re-enter the room. The Deputy looks up..

Deputy: Get him? The man shakes his head. 101-G THORNTON, HIS FACE TWISTED WITH PAIN AND BITTERNESS, makes no attempt â¢to struggle as he .is pulled to his feet and moved out the door.

Pike: He's had five years on the r ck pile, Dutch -- and twenty more to u go -- that.can hurt a man.

Lyle: (after a moment) Say -- I've heard it's like the.old times in Argentina...3utch Cassidy down. there making a killing...

Pike.: Bolivia...but it'll be over there too, pretty soon. Those :pining companies will bring down a bunch .of hardcases and Butchtll get his..

Dutch:

Pike: Fo -- but he takes a dim view of 20 more years in the Carcel --

(then): We can hope he ain't on. our tail -- but don't bet on it..

Lyle:

(happily): Tector and I have been stealing since the big depression and we ain't never been caught. This Thornton don't bother us nohe..

Pike:

Thornton: Tell me, Mr. Harrigan.-- how does it feel? (as Harrigan looks at him) Getting paid for it? (stepping closer) -Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you? How does it feel to be so damned right;?

Harr igan: (after a moment, coldly) Good, Mr..Thornton...it feels good.

Thornton:

Harrigan: (grinning at him) You have 30 days to get him -- or 30 days to Yuma. You're my Judas Goat, Mr. Thornton. (motioning to the bunkhouse) Use them -- lead them -- get Pike -- then kill them off. When you come back, I: want all of them head down over a saddle.

The men sit attentively on the bunks. and.foot lockers., Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger book. After making a 'notation, he looks up..

Harrigan: The hard money value of the men killed less my commi.sson amounts to. one hundred and fifty dollars. 104 THE MEN MUMBLE AND SHIFT. Harrigan holds up four wanted posters. The bounty hunters move closer for a better look.

Harrigan: Bishop... .Engstrom... .Lyle and Tector Gorch...are worth a total of four thousand five hundred dollars -- and you let them all ride outs (after a moment) Any one'of these pelts would not only clear you with the company,.but would mean a bundle of cash to raise hell with. Harrigan stands, crosses to the door.

T.c.: How '.bout a little liquor money for tonight, Mr. Harrigan?

Harrigan: There won't be any tonight -- you move after them in ten minutes -- (turning back) Get them -- get Pike and youtre rich.

Sykes: Them others ain't comin'?

Pike: No.

Sykes: (after a moment) None of 'em? 111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as the others do the same.

Sykes: (joining him again; worried) But I got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said --

Pike: They won't need them -- we will. Sykes thinks this over, finally nods. a little and turns away. 115 LYLE AND HIS BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around the poncho. waiting.

Tector: And I figure a 'share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much. ll& PIKE TAKES A KNIFE OUT OF HIS BELT, opens a saddle bag,. takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open.

Lyle: You hear me, Pike? -- I said it ain't fair... Pike stands,. flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers.
