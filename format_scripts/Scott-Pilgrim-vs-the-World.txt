1 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 1

Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:

Kim pine (o.s.): Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

2 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 2

Four twenty-somethings lounge around a small kitchen table. STEPHEN STILLS, 25, shaggy hair, Canadian Cowboy chic.

Stephen stills: Really? Is she hot? KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper.

Kim pine: How old are you now, Scott? Like twenty-eight?

Scott: I'm not playing your little games.

Kim pine: So you've been out of high school for like, 13 years and-

Scott (o.s.): I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two!

Stephen stills: And you're dating a high school girl? Not bad, not bad. YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts.

Young neil: Like, did you guys 'do it' yet? SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an unruly yet adorable mop of hair.

Scott: We have done many things. We ride the bus. We have meaningful conversations about how yearbook club went and about her friends and, um...you know...drama.

Stephen stills: Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?

Kim pine: Well. Aren't you pleased as punch?

Stephen stills: So, what's her name?

Scott: (pleased as punch) Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

Stephen stills: (under his breath) Chinese... Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS.

Young neil: Wicked! How'd you meet her?

Scott: I believe I mentioned the bus? Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match, sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

Mother chau: You are seventeen year old! Time to get interested in boy!

Knives chau: Mom! Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

Mother chau: You drop book. Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

Scott (o.s.): Hey... Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

"SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME." Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5

An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

Scott: You promise to be good?

Knives chau: Of course I'll be good!

Scott: No, really. Please be good.

Knives chau: Am I normally not? Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

Scott: Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.

Stephen stills: Hey. STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

Stephen stills: Is she gonna geek out on us?

Knives chau: Hi, sorry, what was your name?

Kim pine: ...yes.

Knives chau: That is so awesome.

Scott: Knives, that's Young Neil.

Knives chau: Hi. What do you play?

Young neil: Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's kind of a big question. Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.

Young neil: Oh. I'm not in the band. I just live here. Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.

SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks unintelligable lyrics. Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering.

Knives chau: You guys...are so...amazing.

9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

Scott: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

Wallace: Is he cute?

Scott: Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Wallace: Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together?

Scott: Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.

Wallace: Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

Scott: So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people.

Scott: Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.

Stacey (o.s.): Seventeen years old? Scandal! Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'If you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'.

"STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."

Scott: That's not true. Who told you?

Stacey: Wallace. Duh.

Scott: That gossipy bitch.

Wallace (o.s.): You know me. Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

Scott: Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

Stacey: Who is this mysterious child you date?

Scott: Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

Stacey: A seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

Scott: It's a Catholic school too.

Stacey: With the uniform and everything?

Scott: Yeah, the whole deal.

Stacey: Oh my God, you haven't-

Scott: No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once.

Stacey: Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

Scott: I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple.

Stacey: It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named. Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine, looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

Stacey (cont'd): So, are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane? Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times.

Scott: Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

Wallace: I do not want to be here. At all.

Scott: This school has boys too.

Wallace: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a seventeen year old.

Scott: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like...

Wallace: Yes. Does he wear glasses?

Scott: Wallace, you go now! Begone! Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.

Wallace: You're too good for him. Run.

11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION). They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

Scott: Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

Knives chau: Ohmigod, like...wow.

Scott: Yeah. Wow. The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8... Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.

Knives chau: Oh, I got it!

Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.

"JULIE, 22, STILLS' GIRLFRIEND, RATING: WHAT IS HER PROBLEM?"

Knives chau: Excuse me, do you have anything by 'The Clash At Demonhead'?

Scott: Here you go.

Knives chau: Wow.

Scott: Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...

16 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY 16

...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus.

Scott: Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.

Mysterious girl: You're not alone. You're just having some idiotic dream.

Scott: Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone...

Other scott: Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me not interested.

Scott: But there was this girl...

Wallace: Girl?

Other scott: Was this an Envy related dream?

Wallace: We don't use the E-word in this house.

Scott: No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...

Other scott: Yay for that. Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes.

Wallace: Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?

Scott: What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.

Scott (cont'd): Arrrrgh!

Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library. He carries a stack of books for Knives.

Scott: Libraries remind me of grade school.

Knives chau: That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago.

Scott: Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.

Knives chau: Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

Knives chau: Scott? Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.

Scott: Hey, you know Pacman?

Ramona: I know of him. Scott begins to babble.

Scott: Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F'? You know? Like...

Ramona: Yeah that's amazing.

Scott: Um...am I dreaming? Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.

Scott (cont'd): I'll leave you alone forever now.

"THEN HE STALKED HER FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY..." Series of quick shots as Scott follows Ramona. He ducks around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude. Ramona leaves the party. Scott grabs a startled Young Neil.

Ramona: How's dinner coming along?

Wallace: I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush. Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.

Scott: Don't go.

Wallace: Will you man the hell up? You could get to 2nd and a half base.

Narrator: Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since.

Ramona: Sounds like a bad time.

Scott: Not really.

Narrator: It was.

Scott: It was a mutual thing.

Narrator: It wasn't.

Scott: I mean, she told me it was mutual.

Narrator: She dumped him. It was brutal.

Ramona: You seem a little...heightened.

Scott: Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

Ramona: What is this place?

Scott: ...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!

Ramona: In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being lots of drama.

Lucas lee:

Hey!!!: Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.

Ramona: He just followed me around. He was a little snot nosed brat.

Scott: Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done- Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

Lucas lee (o.s.): Looks like you're seeing double. Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines. POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

Lucas lee: He's good, right? Sometimes I let him do wide shots if I feel like getting blazed back in my winnie. Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

Lucas lee: I'm nothing without my stunt team. The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

Scott: Lesbian?

Wallace: The other L-word.

Scott: Lesbians?

Wallace: Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be with her! It's your destiny!

(beat): Plus, I need you to move out. Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell.

Scott: Ovo what?

Todd ingram: I partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face.

Envy: Short answer: Being vegan just makes you better than most people.

Todd ingram: Bingo. Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

Stephen stills: Hey man, question. I always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers?

Todd ingram: You know how you only use ten percent of your brain? Well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey.

Kim pine: Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

Todd ingram: Go ahead and get snippy baby, if you knew the science, maybe I'd listen to a word you're saying. Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

Ramona (v.o.): I was only dating Lucas until the minute Todd walked by. I guess that's not very nice, but I used to be kind of...like that. Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making out with Young Todd.

Ramona (v.o.): We hated everyone. We wrecked stuff. Nobody cared. Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.

Ramona (v.o.): He punched a hole in the moon for me. It was pretty crazy. Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

Ramona (v.o.): A week and a half later, he told me his Dad was sending him to the Vegan Academy, so I dumped him. Does that help you at all? The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

Scott: Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with? You've never been the dumpee? Ramona shrugs.

Kim pine: Your bad is saying my bad. Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.

Stephen stills: We shouldn't even be here. We shouldn't even be here. Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.

Scott: Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything.

Kim pine: Did you speak to Ramona then?

Scott: What? No. I haven't seen her since the other night.

Kim points to RAMONA in the crowd. She is totally there. Her hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses. They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.

Kim pine: Scott? Not that I care...but you should talk to her before she's gone...

Scott:

Thanks ki-:

Kim pine: And I really don't care. Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then- Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage. A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear, sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands. KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese. Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.

Stephen stills: Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean, we can do this. Right?

Kim pine: Right.

Stephen stills: Scott? Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him.

Kim pine: Scott! Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

Audience dude (o.s.): They brought the house down. Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth shaking BASS NOTE blows the dust off Sex Bob-Omb... Scott and Stills get into battle position. Scott screams!

SAD AND STUFF! 1-2-3-4! Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome. Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON! Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers. Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.

Stephen stills: Let's break up now and get it over with. We screwed the pooch in front of Gideon Graves. We're done.

Scott: Gideon...is here? Where? Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

Scott: That's Gideon? Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

Scott: Alright. Let's do this! Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI! The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music. The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in time to the music! Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon.

'+999 rocking':

Kim pine: That...was epic. The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears, hovering next to Scott. Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

Stephen stills: Scott. What are you doing?

Scott: Getting a life. Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still- applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

Knives chau: I just came to see the show. I'm not even stalking you. Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

Scott: You seem... different. Knives shrugs, different.

Knives chau: I feel like I know stuff now. Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

Scott: Ramona... Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

Scott: Oh okay... A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

Ramona: It's Gideon. I just...I can't help myself around him.

Voice (o.s.): That's the bad news. GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

Gideon graves: The good news, Scottie, is I'm officially loving the Sex Bombs.

Scott: Bob-omb.

Gideon graves: Three piece rock outfit with a semi- attractive female drummer? Music to my earholes. Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga. TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'PEE'.

Gideon graves: You know, I'm not even going to wait to see how you guys do in the final. I'm signing you right now for a three album deal. Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.

Scott: Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge.

Gideon graves: Scottie, buddy, can I just say, keep your emotions in check. Don't let what's past screw up your future. Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

Stephen stills: The people need to hear us, Scott.

Scott: Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

Gideon: Looks like we're all set. Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

Gideon: Oh and Scott, we should really be thanking each other. I mean, if it wasn't for me, you would have never been with Ramona, but if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be back with me. So I guess it all shakes out. Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

Gideon: And hey, the whole League of Evil Exes thing? I was in a dark place when I put that together. Forgiven? Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-

Scott: The wha?

Stacey: I mean, did you really see a future with this girl?

Scott: Like...with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.

Stacey: Time heals all wounds, little brother. Maybe next time let's not date the girl with eleven evil ex- boyfriends.

Comeau: Yeah, their first album is so much better than their first album. Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

Stephen stills (cont'd): Let it go. Don't give him the satisfaction.

Scott: What if I want the satisfaction?

Stephen stills: Well, then you're doomed.

Scott: Well I ain't moving...buddy.

Gideon graves: You want to fight me for her?

Scott: Was that not clear? (to Sex Bob-Omb) Was that not clear? Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

Gideon graves: Now why on earth do you want to do that?

Scott: Because, I'm in love with her. Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT. Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS. Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

Gideon graves: Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle. He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there. Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands. Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

Scott: Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

Gideon: If my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. And fast entrance into HELLLLLLL. Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

Knives chau (o.s.):

Scooooooooott!!!: KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

Ramona: You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

Gideon: You can't say I don't know how to put on a show. GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

Ramona: What the hell is your deal?

Knives chau: You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE.

Ramona: I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

Ramona: You cheated on me with Knives?

Scott: No! I cheated on Knives. With you.

Ramona: Is there a difference?

Scott: You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat.

Scott: Right? Knives and Ramona stare at Scott.

Gideon (o.s.): Game over! STAB! A sword pierces Scott's chest from behind.

Ramona: Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention.

Scott: So why go back?

Ramona: I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head.

Scott: Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now...

Ramona: No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.

Ramona: But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,

Scott: Knives?

Ramona: I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.

Scott: I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.

But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you.

Wallace (o.s.): Sure thing, guy.

He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'. Ramona KICKS.

Scott lands hard. Gideon lands in front of him and raises his sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE, cancelling out Gideon's digital sword. Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom. Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon. COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each impact. Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass. Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor, she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning. Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

Gideon (cont'd): Who do you think you are Pilgrim? You think you're better than me? I'll tell you what you are. A pain in my ass. You know how long it took to get all the evil exes' contact information so I could form this stupid league? Like two hours! Gideon starts to pixellate quite badly. Not long now...

Gideon (cont'd): You're not cool enough for Ramona. You're zero. You're nothing. Me? I'm what's hip. I'm what's happening. I'm blowing up right now.

Scott: You're right. I'm not cool enough for Ramona. And you got another thing right. You are blowing up. Right now. Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face. Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-

Poooooooooooom!!!: SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.

Young neil: Whoa...

Kim pine: There goes our deal.

Stephen stills: We're still getting paid, right? Kim points to the falling coins.

Kim pine: There goes our deal.

Young neil: Oh... Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins. The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in their kung fu poses. They share a smile.

Ramona (o.s.): You two make a good combo. Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them.

Scott: Yeah?

Ramona: Yeah.

The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's fallen glasses. The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

Gideon's voice (o.s.): You can defeat me...but can you defeat...yourself? Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and Scott whips around to face...

Knives chau: Negascott! NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed hair. Dark clothes. Evil face. Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

Scott: No. This is something I have to face on my own. The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward to confront his dark side. Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

100-103 omitted 100-103:

104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre. They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott. Then... Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

Knives chau: What happened?

Scott: Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit. He's a super-nice guy. We actually have a lot in common. Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

Knives chau: Your hair.

Knives chau: It's getting really shaggy. Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

Scott: Yeah?

Knives chau: I like it. Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

Scott: You do? Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness. Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

Scott: Hey... Where are you going? Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

Ramona: I dunno. I should probably disappear.

Scott: After all that?

Ramona: It's hard, you know? I came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up. I'm tired of people getting hurt because of me. Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

Scott: I think I understand. Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

Ramona: I should tahnk you, though.

Scott: For what?

Ramona: For being the nicest guy I ever dated.

Scott: That's kind of sad.

Ramona:

(almost laughing): It is kind of sad. She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

Ramona: Well... Bye and stuff.

Scott: Yeah. And stuff. She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

Knives (o.s.): Go get her. Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

Scott: Wha?

Knives: You earned it. You've been fighting for her all along.

Scott: But what about you?

Knives: (totally sweet and sad) I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you anyway. She grins and kisses his cheek.

Knives: There's someone out there for me. We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her. Guitar still in hand. We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame. Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

Knives: Go talk to her. Before she's gone. Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

Scott (o.s.): Hey... mind if I tag along?

104 CONTINUED: (4) 104
Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

Ramona: You want to come with me?

Scott:

(hopeful): I thought maybe we could... try again? Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene earlier. Scott takes it. We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the middle of the street, snow swirling around it. Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning to spring. Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of 'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's cell phone airwaves.

Julie (v.o.): Oh my God, can I blow your mind? Scott Pilgrim totally threw down with Gideon Graves at the grand opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it was apparently awesome.

Stacey (v.o.): Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I mean bananas. My little brother kicked a guy's head off. Literally. It was unbelievable. Someone seriously should have been filming it. Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.
