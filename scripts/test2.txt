                                KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            world-weary air)
                   At least once a month.  Douglas
                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve
                   years you've been talking about
                   Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   That's right, Douglas.  But not
                   you.  Not us.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (mumbling)
                   What do they expect ... the
                   way men dress these days ...
                   then they scream rape--
