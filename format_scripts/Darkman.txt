INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY


Bang!!: A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

Close shot:: A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back.

Black: Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness.

Black: No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching.

Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're ready to kick some ass.

Dock worker: Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

Dock worker #2: Bunch a cuties.

Dock worker #3: Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one. From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up in silence.

The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now...total silence.

Robert g. durant: the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

Durant: Now let's consider my points, one by one...

Guzman: puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant.

Durant: One... He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer.

Eye: Blinking.

Nose: The nostrils flare slightly.

Eye: Looking.

Nose: Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- B- DEEEE -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its strobe recharging. B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right nose profiles.

Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

Peyton: Pacing, thinking;

Peyton: Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.

Yaxitito: snags the ball angrily from the air.

Yakitito:

(furious): It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.

Peyton: Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.

Yakitito: This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks.

Yakitito: Amazing. It work every time.

Strack jr.: How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction.

Strack sr.: I don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating. Where's Herb Gorson?

Julie: Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework.

Jodhpured equestrians gallop past in the distance. Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz. Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee.

Katz: We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price.

Pleasantly::

Julie: Then I guess we're only missing one element here.

Katz: What's that?

Julie: An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around.

Julie: .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED

Julie: if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact--

Steward: Oui madame. '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is what I have serve. Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him.

Julie: No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais.

You're: Pleasant, but hardly worth charging... Strack Sr., frowning, examines the wine. It's news to him.

Julie: .And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us... Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath:

Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well...

Resident: .and he can't even feel it. With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.

115:

Patient's bandaged face:

115: His eyes still closed. No response.

Resident: Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns follow behind like ducklings.

Trumayne: Alone?

437 the helicopter: swoops lower, slamming the Darkman to the pavement. He drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles WHIZZING past his head. Like a marionette, he's jerked back up right in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the windshield.

Strack sits behind his power desk, talking into the phone..

Strack: We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.

Security officer: Robert Durant, sir.

Strack:

(pleased): Send him in.

(to phone): Goodbye, Governor. Everything's taken care of. He hangs up. We hear the door open and close. Strack's smile vanishes.

Robert durant: enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp.

Strack: You look like hell, Robert.

Durant: The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter.

Strack: And Westlake?

RATTLING up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper,

P44: P446 stars all around us.

Strack: I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model.

Durant: They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.

Strack: Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me...

P446 contikued: Strack gestures broadly with one arm.

Strack: ...It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.

Strack: You don't have any kids, Robert.

Durant: What are you talking about?

Strack: Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?

Dur ant: I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!

Strack: Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.

Durant/ darman:

(rasps): Where's the girl? Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles back over his shoulder.

Strack: You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps.

Strack: ...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind.

Strack: ...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet...

(shrugs): .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few miserable years... Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don't all have what it takes to realize those dreams.

Durant/darkman: All I have are nightmares. A beat.

Strack: Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you.

Strack: I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs.

Strack: .See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You..â¢ ah, here we are.

447: 447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright.

Durant/darkman: Julie! Strack laughs.

Strack: Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..

448: 448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels away again. It spins downward towards a forest of reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat-- pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars.









165.:

449:

449 julie: gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring:

Str.ack: You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.

Blam!: Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage.

The world: Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--

Girder: As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.

ON THE UPPER GIRDER Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV-- nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night. Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.

Julie: recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair.

Strack:

(with remorse): First my wife, then my father, and now

You--: He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push her off the girder. With intensity:

Strack jr.: Father?

Strack sr.:

(horrible rasp): I should've snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for his gun.

451:

451 bam!: Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his hand into the darkness below.

Strack and darxman:

Of: battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet sure death on either side of them.

Bam! bam! bam!: Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack crawls toward them.

A rivet gun: only a few inches from his grasp.

Dariom: swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.

Stracr's hand: inching painfully toward the rivet gun.

Darkman: pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.

Strack: lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.

Zmmmmmm! z !:

452: 452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist, then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam... Strack takes a step backward, exhausted.

Strack: Now you get to watch your girl-friend die. He moves toward a terrified Julie.

Darxman: SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the hot soup of rage.









454 crack!: Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find--

455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455 Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked. 456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456 dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands. 457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457 head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body. Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears a funny little hat. 458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458 the face of the Darkman. 459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459 bursts into flames. 460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460 pulsing madly.

461 DARXMAN'S RIVETED HAND 461 insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.

Darkman:

HUMMING at the cut. Darkman and Julie are inside. Darkman remains turned from Julie, facing the shadows. Gently, Julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward her.

Julie: Peyton, I can help.

Darkman: No one can help.

Julie: I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

Darkman: Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

Darkman: It disgusts you.

Julie: No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

Finally::

Darkman: This hand... it used to caress you. Now it can only tear, rip away at things.

Julie:

Darkman: It's not just the scars. I've changed- He grips his skull.

Darkman: Peyton is gone... 466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she desperately searches for him, turning people around, staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

Julie: Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves.

(tears in her AS WE ROLL END CREDITS The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians, any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards, wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street- person shuffles into view:
